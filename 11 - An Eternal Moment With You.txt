I put up with everything.
I believed that if I put up with the pain,
there'd be light at the end of the tunnel.
But, nothing changed.
The light just got farther away, and darkness still surrounds me.
Nothing changes.
I can't change anything.
That's why...
I'm going to stop now.
I can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave your name
and message after the tone.
ASAHI KOUBE
I FOUND SHIO. MEET AT THE PARK.
W-What's going on!?
Matsuzaka, what are you doing?
Didn't he leave for another city?
No! No! You're not the one who's getting Shio-chan!
I'm the one who's going to be
Shio-chan's knight!
Huh?
Why am I...
My head hurts...
Hi.
Be quiet. There's something I want to ask you.
This is the girl
who helped me with you, right?
So, you knew?
You gave me information about Shio even though you knew?
You're an accomplice?
If you make a scene, I'll beat you.
Her name is Satou Matsuzaka.
She's protecting Shio.
Or keeping her locked up.
Anyway, she's with Shio-chan.
But that's all I know!
I don't know where Matsuzaka is.
It's true! Please, believe me!
I lied to you
because she told me that if I did that,
she'd let me see Shio-chan.
That's right! You're looking for Shio-chan, right?
Let's work together and save Shio-chan!
I can talk to Matsuzaka.
If we work together, we can get Shio-chan back!
Now that's a good plan!
What are you talking about?
What makes you think you're worth that much?
You smell like a dirty adult.
I don't trust you anymore.
Get a hold of Matsuzaka's address at work.
You'll help me?
I’m not helping. I’m giving you an order.
I know that it hurts
when someone pushes hard on your nails.
The sharp pain of having your nail ripped off...
Then, a dull pain ensues and persists...
Oozing... Oozing...
The pain controls your mind.
Can you stand
that pain?
I got it! I got it!
Find her address and contact me.
-Go! -O-Okay.
When we die,
I'll be your partner in crime.
Thanks, Shio-chan.
I was happy when you said you'd fight together with me.
Thanks to you,
I was able to stand again.
Let's live together.
So we don't lose each other in the darkness,
let's keep shouting "I love you."
That's what I'm going to live for.
That reason only.
Oh... What happened?
Come on. Come inside.
Satou-chan, welcome.
Starting today, this is your new home.
Love...
Love... Love...
Love is different for every person.
The way it shines is different.
But anyone can receive it.
Once you experience it, your heart feels fulfilled in an instant.
I'm coming!
Welcome! I was waiting for you.
It'll be fine!
Love is something that can't be seen.
Love...
Auntie, you're hurt again.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
I'm okay.
This is also love.
There are many different flavors of love.
Strawberry, lemon, apple, and mint.
There are also poisonous ones.
Taste it. Swallow it.
As long as there's some in the jar.
When they run out, you add more.
Over and over again.
When I do that, I feel surrounded by love,
and I feel happy.
But, my heart still had a big hole in the middle
all along.
Auntie. Will you hear me out?
What is it?
I killed someone.
For someone I love.
I’ll destroy the evidence to pursue love,
and travel far away, just the two of us. Help us out.
Satou-chan, you're so amazing.
Are you calling the police?
No.
Some of the people that came here
also did things like that.
But I loved them too.
That's what my love is.
So, of course...
I love you too, Satou-chan!
But I'm not your one and only love, right?
You love everyone.
There’s no one you love the most.
I don't call that love.
I'm sure of it now.
Auntie.
Your love is wrong.
Ever since I was a child,
I wanted to experience love.
You can't see love.
I didn't know what it looked like.
But I finally know what it looks like now.
When I met her,
I felt fulfilled for the first time in my life.
It was like a piece of snow.
I held onto it, and tried to take care of it.
At times, I failed.
But still,
she continues to fulfills me.
It's strange.
It keeps changing.
I can't help but think
it's something sweeter than sugar.
It's priceless and special.
That's what my love is.
Oh. Good.
You found love.
I'm not going to criticize your love.
But you're still a kid.
A kid who can't take responsibility for herself.
You want to overstep your bounds?
Do it once you've grown up.
That's right. You're completely dependent on adults, after all.
You sponge off and cling onto them to live.
That's how it works, Satou-chan.
You can't pursue love alone.
That's the reality of things.
Don't worry, Satou-chan.
You'll grow up someday.
You'll grow up into a dirty adult in no time.
So,
keep acting like an innocent child.
Even if you can't get what you want,
you can still do your best.
That's all you can do.
You're just a cute kid.
You taught that kid the wrong idea about love.
That's why you have a responsibility to pay me back.
A responsibility to help me.
Take responsibility for doing this to me.
You're a dirty adult. Take responsibility, Auntie.
Responsibility, huh?
I've never thought about it before.
Okay, Satou-chan.
I'll help you.
Let me watch your love until the end.
And what happens to you in the end.
I'll come again.
Hey, Satou-chan.
You killed that little bird, right?
It's okay.
I won't do anything.
I'll help you.
I swear on my love.
But... I see...
She's gone now.
That's too bad.
11TH LIFE: AN ETERNAL MOMENT WITH YOU
Mitsuboshi! What a relief!
Sorry.
Sorry to make you worry.
I thought I'd say hi today.
I'm glad you came back.
Actually, we're in a tight spot.
Last night, Matsuzaka told us she can't come in for a while.
I thought I'd ask Shoko to work instead,
but I can't get a hold of her.
Sorry I can't help.
It’s not your fault.
We'll get through this today.
You're more than welcome to start tomorrow.
-Okay. -Thanks.
There it is! This is it!
DEAR HOMES APT. 305
This is good.
Hida...
They can't get a hold of her?
Stop. I don't have time to think about it now.
I’m not helping.
I’m giving you an order.
That's right.
I don't have to take orders from you!
-Shio-chan, are you scared of cars? -A little.
It'll be fine.
-I'll hold your hand. -Okay.
Satou-chan! Thanks for waiting!
Auntie, that was dangerous.
Can you really drive?
It'll be fine! Oh!
So, you're Satou-chan's love.
You're so small and cute!
I'm Satou-chan's aunt. Nice to meet you!
I'm Shio Koube!
I've been together with Satou-chan!
Nice to meet you!
Shio-chan. She's kind of weird.
Don't talk to her too much.
Huh? But she's your aunt, right?
I want to be friends!
Shio-chan!
Oh, Satou-chan!
You look so cute when you're with the person you love!
Well then, let's go!
HOME CENTER WINTER
My crimes are all in that room.
That's why I want to erase them without a trace.
Good idea.
Kose... Remember that policeman?
I asked him about it.
But no one has reported
that anything happened to the little bird yet.
After I take care of this,
I plan to go somewhere where no one knows us.
We're going to live together in a new place.
What a nice honeymoon!
We have to buy time until we can escape completely.
So, our story is that I'm the one who died in that room.
I'm not at home right now.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey! What's taking you so long? Hurry up and call me back!
Shio-chan's on the other side of this door!
Shio-chan's right here!
Just thinking about it
makes my body shiver in pleasure!
Shio-chan's voice, her smell...
I can experience them again!
Shio-chan!
I've come for you!
Shio-chan?
Shio-chan? Where are you?
This isn't Shio-chan's sweet smell...
Oh...
Are you starving for love too?
I hope today will be the start of a good journey.
Let's make a vow.
An eternal vow.
Shio-chan!
Yeah. Let's begin.
Our vows.
In sickness
and in health,
through happiness
and sadness,
for richer,
for poorer...
until death do us part...
I wish to stay connected with you forever, Shio-chan.
I wish to be together with you forever, Satou-chan.
This is a symbol of our love.
I vow that I love you, Shio-chan.
I vow that
I love you, Satou-chan.
Tomorrow, we'll leave this place and find a new castle.
But, I don't need a castle.
As long as you're with me, that's enough for me!
I'd do anything for you, Shio-chan.
I can feel the hole in my heart
filling up.
This love
is forever.
Satou-chan!
Shio-chan!
Satou-chan!
Shio-chan!
12th Life: Happy Sugar Life.
