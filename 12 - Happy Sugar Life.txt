We have to say goodbye to this castle today.
Yeah.
But, you know...
A future filled with nothing but fun is waiting for us.
It will only have sparkling,
sweet, and soft things.
I know!
Can I bring this too?
Of course!
Let's say goodbye
to all the bitter...
painful...
and scary things.
Poor thing.
There's still some thick stuff
left inside you.
But don't worry.
I'll...
eat it all.
ASAHI KOUBE
I must do it.
For my and Shio-chan's bright future.
The disgusting past...
The crime I committed...
I'm going to bury it all away.
It's all for our love.
Satou-chan! Satou-chan!
What, Shio-chan?
Auntie.
Here. This is for you.
It's better if you had this, right?
Satou-chan.
I still love you,
the same way I did on the day I first met you.
-Auntie. -What?
Goodbye.
Yeah. Goodbye.
It'll be okay. Let's go.
Okay!
Satou-chan... I wonder if you realize
how you look
when you're with that girl.
ASAHI KOUBE
It's me.
How long are you going to keep me waiting?
Hey!
I was abused again...
I've become filthy.
Where are you right now?
I'm at Matsuzaka's apartment.
Apartment No. 305
-Are you sure? -I am!
Hurry, or else I'll go insane!
Help!
TO AIRPORT
What's wrong, Satou-chan?
I forgot something.
-Your ring? -Yeah.
How could I forget something so important?
Sorry, Shio-chan.
It's okay. Let's go back.
Do we still have time?
Yeah. It'll be fine.
Thanks.
Apartment No. 305.
-Are you sure? -I am!
Shio's there too?
Please come. Hurry.
How dare you say that.
You tried to trick me.
Shio's not there.
I don't care what happens to you.
Please!
Wait, Shio!
-Thanks for waiting. -Did you find it?
-Of course. -Let me see.
-Satou-chan, hold out your hand. -Okay.
-Here. -Thanks.
I'll never take it off ever again.
This time, we really have to say goodbye.
Goodbye, our castle.
-Let's go. -Yeah!
I wonder if Satou-chan already left the city.
Well, then...
Oh, no...
I need to get out of here, now!
She's not here.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Shio-chan, let's eat breakfast at the airport.
Does the airport have someplace to eat?
I looked it up. There are lots of places to eat.
Goodbye, little bird.
I wonder if there's a cake shop.
You want cake for breakfast?
That sounds nice.
-Let's look for one together. -Okay.
Oh, I want to eat Black Forest cake again!
It was really good.
Shio!
Finally...
I finally found you! I've come to get you!
Wait! Shio!
Give Shio back to me!
Damn!
Satou-chan...
Let's run away.
Auntie should be on the move by now.
We can't go upstairs.
Let's go to Auntie's apartment first.
Shio-chan!
I knew you'd be here!
What are you doing here?
What am I doing?
I'm getting Shio-chan back from you, Matsuzaka.
It has begun...
Taiyo...
Shio-chan, this way! Hurry!
Wait, don't go!
Shio-chan!
Please wait! My angel!
OPEN
That guy's down there.
Maybe I can still make it around from upstairs...
But...
That girl...
Damn!
Shio, where are you? Shio!
Shio!
No. No...
I'm sure there's light at the end of your journey.
So promise me...
that you're going to smile at the end. Okay?
It's not opening!
-You! -Shio-chan, go outside!
Stop!
12th Life: Happy Sugar Life
Satou-chan! Satou-chan, are you okay?
It's your fault, Satou Matsuzaka.
Let's go home, Shio.
Shio-chan!
Satou-chan! I'm not going.
I'm going to stay with Satou-chan!
What are you talking about?
She killed her own friend!
I know.
What?
Mom is waiting too!
It's okay. I'm going to stay here with Satou-chan.
You...
Let's go.
Don't hurt her!
No...
I...
-Get away from her! -Satou-chan!
I'm not going to let you take Shio-chan!
Shut up.
It's because of you...
It's because of you...
That's why Shio--
Stop!
Don't hurt Satou-chan!
I don't care about my family.
I care about Satou-chan most!
Shio...
Really? You...
You must be mad at Mom...
I heard from Mom.
She said she abandoned you.
She said she let go of your hand.
You're right. It's unforgivable.
But the reason Mom abandoned you isn't because she hated you.
Mom realized this when she hit you that day.
She realized she had started to become just like that horrible man.
That's why she needed to be away from you!
She was afraid of turning into someone terrible who would hurt you.
On that day...
Mom came home right after abandoning you.
That kid's so late.
Come on.
Damn!
Mom's the one who killed that devil!
She sacrificed herself to protect us.
I wanted to tell you.
I can't blame her.
Mom is a victim, just like us.
Please...
come with me.
Mom committed a crime. I'm sure they'll arrest her.
At least hold her hand in the end.
It'd be too cruel if you didn't.
Then what about when she said she didn't need me?
"Shio doesn't need me anymore"!
That's what Mom said!
She'd never say she doesn't need you!
Brother...
Shio-chan.
-Shio. -Tell Mom...
Tell her thanks for releasing me from an unhappy life.
That's why I'm going to live for myself!
Shio?
Don't come any closer!
Why?
Why, Shio?
-Shio-chan. -I chose Satou-chan.
I need Satou-chan.
No...
Shio!
Wait, Shio!
Shio!
Satou-chan, does it hurt?
I'm fine.
But...
We can't go to our new castle anymore.
-Sorry. -No, it's okay.
I feel the happiest when I'm with you, Satou-chan.
Shio-chan.
Hey, Satou-chan. This is what I think...
Back there, when my mom abandoned me,
I think I was dead.
I was sad and in pain.
I didn't care about anything. Everything was blank.
But then you came, Satou-chan.
I'm so happy I met you and was able to live with you.
Me too, Shio-chan.
So I want to be with you, Satou-chan.
I want to be happy together with you at the end.
So let's die together, Satou-chan.
Shio-chan.
I didn't know...
what warmth felt like...
what kindness was...
or what affection was.
And more than anything else,
I couldn't understand
what love was.
It's all thanks to Shio-chan.
It's because Shio-chan took my hand that one time.
Shio-chan led me.
I learned what happiness meant for the first time in my life.
I never understood love before.
But Shio-chan is the one who taught me what love means.
Satou-chan!
I see!
This is an even deeper feeling for Shio-chan.
I... finally...
Shio-chan.
I hope you still love me when we're reborn.
I'm sorry...
and thanks.
This is an update regarding the apartment building that collapsed a few days ago.
The burned body found on the 12th floor where the fire started, was identified as Shoko Hida.
MULTIPLE ARSON CASUALITIES
The person who fell from the roof of the building was identified as Satou Matsuzaka.
Matsuzaka's aunt is a suspect in this crime.
Yes!
It was me!
No! No, there's been a mistake!
No! This is bad!
Beautiful... Dirty... Cute... Ugly...
Shio-chan, my angel...
up in the sky.
The moon's still there in the blue sky.
It's so faint it looks like it's about to disappear.
It's doesn't light up anything anymore.
But from now on, I...
KOUBE
I'm coming in.
Shio... How do you feel?
It's okay. There's nothing to be afraid of anymore!
We'll be here forever.
So...
Let's live together, Shio.
Sorry.
I don't do that stuff anymore.
I've been reborn.
What?
My love... My happiness...
exists only inside of me.
I don't know why Satou-chan kept me alive.
I'm going to keep thinking about it forever.
Forever and ever and ever...
We're together forever, Satou-chan.
This is my...
happy sugar life.
