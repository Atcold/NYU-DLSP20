I didn't know
what warmth felt like,
what it meant to be kind,
or what affection was.
And above all,
I could not comprehend
the concept of love.
But I get it now.
I've finally...
come to understand...
what love really means.
This is the story of our love.
Satou Matsuzaka, please go out with me.
Sorry. I've already given my heart to someone else.
Hey!
-You get rejected? -Not even.
You said she'd let you bang her, dude.
Thanks for waiting.
-You're going to be late for work. -Sorry.
Those guys were hitting on you, right?
Are you guys hanging out after work?
No. I'm done doing that kind of stuff, Shoko-chan.
I've fallen in love.
You're kidding! You've got a revolving door of men!
We've started living together.
You're not wasting any time.
Don't tell anyone.
You're the only person I've told.
Okay.
That's why I have to make more money.
He's a kept man?
I didn't know you were the type who likes babying guys.
Hey, let's fool around with guys again together.
More importantly, Shoko-chan...
What is it?
Did you gain weight?
I can tell you're 2 percent over your ideal body fat just by touching your body.
Shoko-chan, if you want to land a man,
you have to maintain your figure.
How can you know just by touching?
ANGEL CAFE CURE A CUTE
Welcome home, master!
There, it's a cat!
It's so cute!
I hope it's delicious! I hope it's delicious!
-Congratulations! -Thanks.
Right. I found it.
My beloved.
I'm home!
Satou-chan! Welcome back, Satou-chan!
This nice, sweet smell.
The girl I found.
Shio-chan.
My beloved.
Were you waiting at the front door? Wasn't it cold?
I'm fine. I wanted to welcome you home, Satou-chan.
You're so cute, Shio-chan.
I met Shio-chan a few days ago.
Bubble... bubble...
Bubble... bubble...
Hey, Satou-chan, how come the chick floats?
She wouldn't understand an explanation of Archimedes' principle.
The water is trying to help the chick.
Wow, you're like a professor, Satou-chan!
Shio-chan doesn't know about a lot of things.
Hey. Hey.
I'll be your water, Satou-chan!
Then I'm going to help you
just like this chick!
She's so innocent, so pure.
Shio-chan is so cute.
Satou-chan, here we go!
Go ahead, Shio-chan.
Our vows.
In sickness and in health...
-This girl is the sweetest thing in the world. -through happiness and sadness...
for richer, for poorer...
She fulfills my heart.
I promise to love you, Satou-chan,
until death do us part...
This sparkling emotion must be...
what they call love.
Satou-chan.
I'm so happy.
I want to stay like this forever.
But I can't.
We need money to live.
For food, utilities, furniture, and clothes...
That's why I have to work.
Sorry, Shio-chan.
My new job starts today, so I'll be home late.
Will you be okay on your own?
I know
that you're working hard for me!
So I'll stay here and pray
that we'll be able to be together forever.
Shio-chan...
Okay, Shio-chan.
I'm going to work hard.
I'm Satou Matsuzaka. I'm new here.
I'm going to work hard to learn fast.
Nice to meet you.
I'm so glad you came, Matsuzaka.
We're short on staff these days.
You've worked in customer service, right?
We're counting on you.
Okay.
Matsuzaka. Let me teach you how to take orders.
I know how to work this.
Really? Then can you work the floor now?
Yes. If I do something wrong, just tell me.
Okay. Got it.
Welcome!
How's the new job?
The manager is young, kind, and pretty, right?
Yeah. The other employees are all nice too.
-I won't allow it, you know. -Shoko-chan?
You can't spend all your time at your new job! Got it?
I wouldn't do that.
-Really? -Yeah.
Shio-chan, we don't get that channel.
Work, huh?
Well...
as long as nothing troublesome happens...
I like you. Will you go out with me?
You can give me an answer after your shift's over.
No...
Sorry.
I've already given my heart to someone else.
Satou, I saw you
rejecting Mitsuboshi.
Mitsuboshi's really cool. If you rejected him,
the guy you've given your heart to must be gorgeous.
He's not a gorgeous guy.
There you go again...
You're lucky.
I wish I was pretty like you, Satou.
Then I would've been more popular with guys.
That's not true...
I think you guys are cute when you're smiling.
So please smile more.
I love you, Satou!
I can see why she's so popular.
The guys are into her these days.
They were all about the manager up until now, though.
Thanks for your hard work.
Got to get home quickly.
Mitsuboshi stopped coming to work the next day.
Matsuzaka, can you work overtime today?
I thought you said there's no overtime.
We're short on staff.
And I can't get through to Mitsuboshi.
It's your fault he's not coming anymore, isn't it?
Mitsuboshi was crying.
He said you made a fool out of him.
So it's only natural that you take responsibility for this.
Okay, Matsuzaka?
But...
Poor Satou...
-Thanks. -Thanks for your hard work.
Oh, sorry.
-It was an accident. -I see...
Um...
Don't tell anyone that I snitched.
Do you understand?
I've been working here longer.
If you want to keep working here like nothing happened,
then you should do exactly as the manager says.
Thanks for your hard work.
Matsuzaka.
The bathroom and break room too, thank you.
Things went on like that for a while...
This...
This can't go on...
Satou-chan...
I can't go on like this.
The bottle inside me is breaking.
The sweet pieces are scattering.
Don't go anywhere. Those are pieces of my love.
Pieces of my heart.
If this keeps up, I...
I'll go crazy.
HAPPY SUGAR LIFE
1ST LIFE: THE SUGAR GIRL EATS LOVE
Thanks for your hard work today.
Don't forget to check your paystubs.
Okay!
Excuse me, manager?
Can I ask you something?
Was there a mistake?
The payment doesn't match the hours I worked. There's a mistake.
No. It's correct.
Matsuzaka,
you know why, don't you?
No. I worked like I was supposed to.
Oh, that's too bad.
Really, you...
You're just a little cute, and you think you can get away with anything.
I bet people went easy on you
and made a big fuss over you just because you're cute.
But life isn't that easy.
You caused trouble here.
That's why your pay was cut.
You understand, don't you?
Are you allowed to cut my pay whenever you want?
Yes.
This place is my kingdom of love.
I'm the master. I have no need for anyone who doesn't love me.
No matter who it is.
Love?
That's right, Matsuzaka,
I love you too.
I'll swallow any desire you have.
After all, Satou-chan...
that's what love is.
No.
I can't agree to this.
You can't. It's just wrong.
You're not supposed to go after underage kids.
-What? -I saw it.
You brought Mitsuboshi here.
So what? Enough with the false pretenses.
They're hardly false.
This place is thick with
the scent of you and Mitsuboshi's deeds.
It's like your gross, damp smell swallowed up Mitsuboshi.
-What? -Then...
I'll just have to ask Mitsuboshi directly.
Well, you won't be able to.
Why's that?
I can.
I said I can.
What's going to happen after that?
The kind and pretty manager
is going to be charged with sexual misconduct.
Could your majesty endure having everyone look at you with disgust?
Who do you think you are?
You're just a kid! You're supposed to respect adults!
How come you weren't able to control yourself with a kid?
-What? -Did it sting that badly...
for everyone to pay more attention to a kid like me than you?
Of course it did!
You guys are supposed to love me!
But Mitsuboshi said he loved you.
So I taught him about my love.
I made sure to thoroughly teach his body.
Of course it did!
What an amazing face.
Give that to me!
I'll upload it somewhere.
Who do you think you are?
Are you threatening me?
Are you trying to destroy my kingdom?
I don't care about your kingdom.
I don't care what you do here, or how you behave.
It really didn't matter one way or the other.
Then why?
Why didn't you control yourself?
I controlled myself.
I worked overtime and I cleaned up.
Because it was part of my job.
I had less time to spend with Shio-chan,
but I controlled myself and did it all.
What are you talking about?
You should have controlled yourself too.
Then neither of us would have had to go through this.
What--? What are you saying?
What you feel may not be love.
Love...
is something your heart feels by itself.
It's sweet, it sparkles,
and it makes you realize what makes you happy
without anyone telling you.
If you had to teach him about your love...
If you ask for something in return...
Something bad and bitter like that...
That's not love.
Hey, manager.
Even if it doesn't interest me, if it's unsightly I want to break it.
I'm sure you know the feeling.
It's okay.
Just pay me what I'm owed, okay?
Are you okay, Mitsuboshi?
Be careful.
Women have a strong desire to keep people to themselves.
So bitter...
So bitter...
So bitter... So bitter...
So bitter... So bitter... So bitter...
Satou-chan, welcome back!
Shio-chan, I'm home!
It's so late. You stayed up?
Yeah. I didn't like falling asleep
without being able to say "Welcome back!"
Shio-chan...
The sick feeling in my stomach went away.
I've never felt like this before.
I'm so happy.
I love you, Shio-chan.
I've never loved anyone before.
I've had lots of people tell me they love me.
But no matter what they told me...
or what they did for me...
I never felt anything.
But this is different.
Shio-chan gave me the gift of love.
I'm sure she's going to teach me more and more about love in the future.
Hey, thanks.
Your house is pretty comfortable.
That's why I have to...
protect this valuable emotion,
and create a castle so the love doesn't spill out.
The sweetest castle in the world, where I can live happily with Shio-chan forever.
MISSING SHIO KOUBE
What I have to do...
This is in the way. I have to throw it away somewhere.
Hello,
happy sugar life.
I'm sure this is love.
I'd do anything to protect this feeling.
2nd Life,
"Shio's Miniature Garden."
The angelic being who suddenly appeared before me
and saved my loveless heart...
Shio-chan.
I have to protect my life with Shio-chan.
Because I want to know more about love.
That's why...
Turns out he had a wife and kids. The jerk told me he was single.
Seriously? No way.
Makes me want to kill him.
Don't kill him.
I was just joking.
Who would kill someone just for love?
I see...
But I do wish my life could be like
an exciting love story.
Like dating a teacher...
Like our homeroom teacher, Kitaumekawa?
That could be nice!
-He's single and he's hot. -You're right.
Matsuzaka.
Do you have a moment?
Kitaumekawa...
Speak of the devil...
Matsuzaka.
I called your house yesterday to talk academics,
but no one answered.
Was something wrong?
I think I was asleep already.
No way. It was about seven o'clock.
I was at work...
and my aunt goes out at night a lot too.
I had heard your parents passed away,
and you're living with your aunt.
-Excuse me. -Matsuzaka...
If you're in trouble, just tell me.
You're... How should I put it?
Less stable than the other girls.
I'm worried about you.
I'm an adult.
I'm sure I can help you.
I've already quit fooling around with boys. I'm fine.
I fell in love for real.
But... Yeah...
There is one thing.
I feel like
someone's stalking me.
But I'm probably just imagining it.
Thanks, teacher.
A stalker?
Are you sure you're not imagining it?
You're cute so you have to be careful.
Remember that customer who wouldn't leave you alone?
Satou-nyan, can you meow on my lap?
Sir, this isn't that sort of business!
What do you mean?
What if it's him?
I'm worried about you, Shoko-chan.
You're pretty harsh.
It's because you never say anything, so I have to.
Just be careful.
The thought of something happening to you...
I can't bear it.
Satou!
I love you!
Okay, you two.
You don't have to show off.
But we are having that new guy start here soon.
It'll be like having a bodyguard.
Will it?
But I'm worried, so be careful!
Get your boyfriend you live with to protect you.
Satou-chan!
Not my boyfriend.
But that girl's the person I love.
It's so confounding.
She fills the holes in my heart like a puzzle,
her sweet pieces complete me.
Shio-chan...
Wait for me just a little longer.
Satou-nyan, you're too fast!
So you noticed?
You had the upper hand.
Why, then, would you come to an alley like this?
I want you to stop.
I thought you'd show up if I did this.
You know everything.
This is who I really am.
What's going on? He's bitter.
I can see it in your eyes.
You're a smart girl.
You're different from those drones.
That's what attracted me to you.
This guy is so bitter.
Why?
You're a teacher.
Is it really okay for you to stalk a student?
You're right.
It's not okay.
Isn't that what's great about it?
It's like walking on a tightrope.
Like almost crossing that line.
Isn't it profound?
I've had my eyes on you since the school entrance ceremony.
You're my type of girl.
This whole time.
This whole time.
This whole time.
I wonder how sweet
your soft hair smells.
I want to caress
your smooth skin
and make it mine.
Just imagining you opening up your body, embarrassed...
I can't resist.
I can give you so much pleasure
that you'd forget about all other men.
You're a terrible adult.
Now, Satou...
Take me to where your roommate is.
-How do you know--? -Adults know a lot of things.
Especially when it comes to their beloved.
And knowing you're going home to someone drives me rather mad.
Bitter... Bitter...
Bitter...
If anyone finds out, you'd be in trouble, right?
It's okay as long as no one finds out.
I'm good at controlling myself.
So bitter... I feel like throwing up.
-So how should I do it? -Bitter.
What do you like about him?
-His face? -Bitter.
-His voice? -Bitter.
-Bitter. -If it's his face, I'll smash it.
If it's his voice, I'll dry it up.
Bitter!
Oh, well.
It can wait until next time.
It's still bitter...
I hate bitter things.
Satou-chan! Welcome home!
You're late.
Shio-chan...
Shio-chan...
I want something sweet...
Shio-chan...
Okay! Kiss!
-It's sweet... -I was eating chocolate!
Do you feel better now?
Hey, do you feel better?
Yeah.
It's too sweet.
That's weird...
Sweetness is all I can feel now.
Shio-chan...
Shio-chan...
Shio-chan, I love you.
I love you.
You fill me up inside with sweet pieces.
This is what love is.
That's why...
Anyone who gets in our way...
Well, I'm off to work.
Bye, daddy!
Be careful!
Teacher, good morning.
2ND LIFE: SHIO'S MINIATURE GARDEN
DAICHI SHIZUKA MINORI KITAUMEKAWA
Are you a student from the school?
Yes. I'm Satou Matsuzaka.
I had a question about class
that I just had to ask.
Sorry to disturb you early in the morning,
but I couldn't wait another minute.
Well, well.
What a passionate student!
-Nice to meet-- -Yes.
Nice to meet you.
Yes...
Matsuzaka. Let's talk while we walk.
Teacher...
You have such a cute wife and kid.
Despite being single.
Why are you hiding the fact you're married?
Just one isn't enough to satisfy me.
I want to have relationships with many women
and love them and be loved.
That's what I call love.
-This is love too. -Love?
You've had several partners too, haven't you?
-Right? -Right?
I don't get that at all.
You just want women to give you pleasure.
You just like the excitement of the risk of being found out.
If you want excitement that bad...
then shall I back you into a corner?
Do you want me to tell your wife and tear apart your family?
Do you want me to tell the school and have you disciplined?
I'm not even the first student you've touched, am I?
You're trash.
This is bad...
This is bad...
This is bad...
Do you understand now?
Teacher, that's not love.
You're just a masochistic pervert.
This is bad.
Why does it feel so good?
I've finally found
my one true love.
A man drunk on his own lust shouldn't be comparing himself to me.
There's one thing I want to ask you about, teacher.
I have some trash I don't know how to get rid of...
I'm going to work hard around the house for Satou-chan!
I know how to do this! Yeah!
What?
Are you having a bad day,
Mr. Vacuum?
I have to fluff this room too.
It won't open.
Oh, well.
I feel reborn because of my love for Shio-chan.
I want to know more about this love.
So I can't let anyone get in the way.
I'll protect our love no matter what.
Our happy sugar life.
Please take this.
Please take this.
Please take this.
I'M LOOKING FOR SHIO KOUBE
Now it's time to cook!
But I don't know how to cook.
Rain?
I can't get it...
It won't reach...
I don't get it...
Spinning...
Spinning...
My head is spinning...
It's not stopping.
I don't know what I should do.
-It hurts... -It's okay.
You don't have to do anything.
She'll come to get you someday.
And then, everything will be just fine, I'm sure.
-So... -Shio-chan...
Satou-chan...
Satou-chan... I...
You took such good care of the house.
Thanks.
Hey, Shio-chan.
There's something I want to ask you.
Who's the person you love the most?
Satou-chan!
Satou-chan, do you feel sick?
Want some chocolate?
-Do you want to kiss? -No!
It's too sweet. I'll melt.
Satou-chan, you're so cute!
-Oh, but can I say something? -What?
I've said this before,
but there really are so many dangers outside.
So you mustn't ever go out there.
Okay.
-Hey, let's do that thing we always do! -Okay.
Our vows.
In sickness and in health,
through happiness
and sadness,
for richer, for poorer...
I promise to love you,
Satou-chan,
until death do us part...
Everything's okay.
Shio-chan's acting normal.
She's not lying either.
Satou-chan, you're so pretty!
Shio-chan really is my Shio-chan. That's enough for me.
Shio-chan's family doesn't matter.
I should be worrying about tomorrow's meals.
So pretty.
Please throw this trash away without anyone noticing.
What's inside?
It's better that you don't know.
That off-putting sensation when I touched it...
It's trash that you can't just throw out...
That faint rotting smell...
I'm working here starting today.
I'm Taiyo Mitsuboshi.
Nice to meet you.
He's hot.
Mitsuboshi?
Matsuzaka?
-Do you guys know each other? -Yeah.
From my old job.
I swear this was a coincidence.
Mitsuboshi, if you have any questions, just ask.
I'll teach you anything.
Mitsuboshi...
let's go to the break room.
Are you okay now?
Ever since that day,
I couldn't handle being around older women.
I feel like throwing up whenever one touches me.
I didn't leave the house for a while because of that.
I see. Are you going to be okay here?
Almost all the employees here are women.
Someone helped me realize
I can't leave things like this.
I have to move on.
I want to become a good person for that person.
-That's why... -I see.
Mitsuboshi, you fell in love with someone, didn't you?
Sorry!
-I know I told you I liked you just recently. -It's okay.
I think it's great to work hard
for the person you love.
Thanks, Matsuzaka.
I'm off. You rest here for a bit.
Dad, Mom...
I'm sorry...
Shio Koube...
She's so cute.
Little girls
are so cute.
Then does that mean I shouldn't approach him?
-He seems okay with girls his age. -Oh, really?
Yeah. But Mitsuboshi already has someone he likes.
Hello?
Oh, sorry, Mother.
I'm going to eat dinner with my friend.
Okay.
Yes.
Bye.
-Did I sound okay? -Yeah.
It's hard having a strict home.
But I have to meet their expectations.
At least on the surface.
You're a good girl, Shoko.
Really?
Even though I'm off to fool around with guys again today?
A good girl with lots of energy!
What's your deal? Filthy little...
What I really want is my own prince, just like Satou.
Take that!
No, thanks!
Damn. He's no good.
He doesn't have any money.
And he's so dirty.
How useless.
What exactly is this?
If she's still alive, I'm sure she wishes she wasn't.
You're right.
-Poor guy... -In sickness...
and in health...
What are you mumbling about?
What are you doing?
Who the hell are you?
Satou!
-Su-chan? -Thanks for your hard work today too.
You're really amazing these days.
You do the work of five people alone.
And you're even taking care of the new employee.
It's nothing. He's my friend.
By the way,
you live pretty close to me, don't you?
Can I come over sometime?
Don't push your way into my life.
Sorry. My aunt wouldn't like it.
Excuse me. Can you give me a hand?
Good...
It's not as bad as it looks.
Thanks for helping.
Can I go home now?
-Yeah. Go ahead. -Sorry.
Excuse me.
What happened to him?
He was getting beat up in the park.
Should we call the police?
Don't tell the police.
They're the same.
They won't do anything.
Every last one of them...
Adults are all repulsive.
I can't trust them.
Matsuzaka.
I'm going to call the manager.
-Can you stay here? -Okay.
I want to go home soon.
I want to feel Shio-chan soon.
-And then... -Our vows...
In sickness
and in health,
through happiness
and sadness,
for richer,
or poorer...
I promise to
-love you... -Stop!
That's...
Wait!
-That's... -Shio...
Those words!
Even if I cry, even if I scream,
even if I cover my ears,
or close my eyes...
There's this vision that never disappears.
3rd Life:
"A Long Monochromatic Night."
Take this!
He's so loud!
Want to bring him to the john?
Yeah, we can't let anyone see us.
It hurts again... My head...
Why?
Is it because I saw the red thing?
Red... No...
No...
It hurts...
I'm scared...
No...
Someone, help me!
It's the person from before...
Is she... my family?
Someone I care about who's always with me...
Hey... Are you going to help me?
Shio, I thought I told you...
not to let go of Mommy's hand.
But you let go of Mommy's hand.
Mom?
You know, Shio...
I'll never ever...
forgive you.
Shio!
Where are you, Shio?
Shio!
-What was that for, all of a sudden? -What?
Isn't she the girl from the missing-person flyer?
She's alive. I'm amazed.
Doesn't that make us amazing for finding her?
Think we'd get a reward or something if we told the cops?
Man, I doubt it.
Hey, I have a plan.
That dirty guy with the hood was looking for her, right?
Let's call him over and beat his ass.
I'm still pissed off.
Good call.
Hey.
Rise and shine, girlie.
Hey, boys!
If you're not busy, I could sure use some playmates.
Yeah. Sure.
Doesn't she look dangerous?
No. She's a good catch.
I can smell it from here.
You never change, you womanizer.
Now then, sweetheart...
Don't tell me, you're a runaway?
Is it because of your parents? I know how you feel.
Always saying, "It's for your own good." "It's because I love you."
Grownups think they know it all. It drives me crazy.
You can come crash at my place.
No one's going to tell you what to do there.
And if you treat me right while you're there,
I'll even give you money.
You want money...
right?
Hey.
Do you have anything you care about more than money?
I do.
Something tells me you wouldn't get it, though.
Hey, you! I'll freaking kill you!
Dumbass! You think you can beat me unarmed?
You bit--
I learned it the hard way.
When the person you care about is gone,
the world looks monochrome.
But...
that night is over now.
Let's all go home, okay?
Wait... What are you--?
Stop!
Shio-chan...
So warm...
So soft. It feels good...
It's really warm...
I love this feeling.
But then why...
did everything go black all of a sudden?
Shio-chan...
It smells like Satou-chan...
The real...
Satou-chan...
Satou-chan!
Satou-chan! Satou-chan! I'm sorry!
I was scared being alone.
I broke our promise.
I went outside to look for you,
but then I got confused.
And then... And then...
Shio-chan, listen.
I'd never leave you and go somewhere else.
That's why this castle exists.
A castle for you and me to live in together happily, forever.
As long as we're here, there's nothing to be afraid of.
I might be late sometimes,
but I'll always come back here.
So it'll be okay.
You don't have to think about anything.
I'll protect you.
Okay...
Shio-chan, don't cry.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Right. This was all my fault.
I shouldn't have believed what Shio-chan said.
When it comes to Shio-chan, I can't help it.
Love really is strange.
Love... Love...
Love...
Love...
Love...
Auntie, you're hurt again.
I'm okay. After all...
This is also love.
But I won't screw up anymore.
I'll never make the same mistake again.
No matter what.
Satou-chan, good morning.
Shio-chan, good morning.
Today we're having...
fried eggs for breakfast. Your favorite!
I put tofu and aburaage in the miso soup.
What do you think?
I'm so happy!
Your fried eggs are so soft and delicious!
Thank goodness.
She's the same Shio-chan as always.
-Thanks for the meal! -Thanks for the meal!
Delicious!
It's sweet when Shio-chan smiles.
But it's also a little...
Hey, Shio-chan.
Last night, did you talk to anyone...
other than me?
I didn't.
I see.
It's soft...
There's something just a bit off.
Maybe something scary happened when she went outside.
It might not be good to dig into things right now.
I did take care of that.
But I'm sure someone must have seen us.
Satou-chan, are you going to be late today too?
I was just lucky yesterday.
Shio-chan, sorry.
I'll come home as soon as I can.
Then let's spend lots of time talking.
Let's take a bath together,
eat dinner, and keep each other company.
Yeah!
I'm going now.
Be careful.
Welcome back,
my happy sugar life.
4TH LIFE: THE SUGAR GIRL DOESN'T NOTICE
Good, good. I got paid.
I've saved up a lot.
Cooking at home really does work.
Satou!
Hey!
Good morning!
How are things between you and Kitaumekawa recently?
Mr. Kitaumekawa?
You guys talk alone sometimes.
How suspicious.
I've told you before.
Mr. Kitaumekawa is just worried about me because I don't have parents.
It's not like that.
Impressive, Kitaumekawa. What a nice guy.
I should go after him.
I don't recommend that.
There you go again.
If that's what you say...
Take this! Tickle, tickle!
-No! Stop! -You live alone with your aunt, right?
Yeah.
I've never seen her before.
What is she like? Is she pretty?
She never says a word about anything I do.
What? That's great, right?
Well, I guess.
STAFF ROOM
I'm not at home right now.
Please leave a message at the--
She didn't answer today either.
I've been calling every day.
I got rid of that trash she gave me the other day.
I didn't ask what was inside, and I didn't check.
None of the teachers, including myself,
have ever met her aunt or heard her voice before.
Is she just refusing to meet us? Or...
But could that really happen?
No. That girl's not normal.
That look in her eyes when she scolded me...
I'll never forget that thrilling feeling she gave me.
How could I ever forget?
More.
Insult me more. Step on me.
Give me more pleasure.
I made it in time.
Satou, they're going to close early today.
Why?
I heard there was a violent crime near here last night.
The victim...
had both eyes gouged out.
According to the rumors!
Really?
That's why they're telling us to go straight home after work today.
I see.
Maybe I'll clean the house today.
Really? That's your priority?
You know...
I saw some guys fighting last night too.
Men can be so scary sometimes.
Satou, marry me!
Hey, you guys.
Chatting and you're late for work?
You guys know it's payday today, right?
Mitori! We're not late yet!
We're safe!
I wish you'd get ready for work earlier than your seniors.
Am I wrong?
Sorry. We'll work extra hard, though.
Matsuzaka, you're working quite a few shifts.
Are you okay?
I mean, it's not like you have money problems, right?
Mitori,
I have a dream.
And it happens to require lots of money.
That's why I want to keep giving it my all.
A dream?
That's wonderful, Satou.
Yeah. It's good to have dreams.
All right, let's get to work!
Yeah!
-Oh, by the way, Matsuzaka... -Yes?
-A package we sent to you was returned. -Let's do this!
We tried sending it a few times, but no one accepted it.
Did anyone tell you?
No.
I'll take it home today myself.
Sorry to cause trouble.
No, it's no problem.
By the way, where's Mitsuboshi today?
He's taking time off.
We're short staffed, but let's work hard.
Yes.
Taiyo?
Taiyo? How do you feel?
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm okay!
Oh, good.
Rest well.
SHIO KOUBE MISSING SINCE APRIL 25
Shio-chan...
She was really cute.
Small... Warm...
and soft...
My...
My angel.
But Shio-chan is a missing person.
Her family must be looking for her.
Despite that, Matsuzaka...
What in the world are you up to?
Are you talking about your family?
Family?
They're looking for you.
Your mom and your dad.
Spinning...
Spinning...
Spinning...
Spinning...
Spinning... Spinning... Spinning...
Shio-chan, I'm back!
Welcome home, Satou-chan!
That tickles.
What?
It's nothing.
Tell me what you said.
I said you're really good at this.
Really?
All right, let's switch.
You be on this side.
I'll wash you next.
You can't, Satou-chan!
Why?
Your breasts would get squished by my head and that's not good.
My breasts will go back to normal. It's okay.
Really?
Shio-chan.
Satou-chan, you're so heavy!
Done!
Wow, hamburger steak!
Delicious.
Make sure you chew your food.
Here, Satou-chan! Say "Ah"!
Delightful!
You're a cutie!
There we go.
Shio-chan?
Good night, Shio-chan.
Oh, we didn't say our vows tonight.
Too bad.
Shio-chan is already asleep.
I've got to ask her to say them for me tomorrow.
Without it, I feel so weak.
This blood
really won't come off.
Oh, well. We're not using this room anyway.
That's enough for today.
Account Balance
I have to work harder.
I have to build a wonderful castle
where I can be with Shio-chan forever.
Satou.
Those who violate love must pay the price.
Such a sin can only be atoned for with punishment.
5th Life: "The Taste of Crime and the Taste of Punishment."
Shio-chan, does it taste bad?
No, it's good.
Really? Good.
Cherry tomatoes are so cute.
Hey, Satou, you seem a little off today.
A little, but I'm okay.
Shio-chan is feeling down.
It has left me feeling so anxious.
Satou, your bag looks so sweet!
It's cute!
Right? I used to be into fake sweets.
Satou.
Shoko's taking a day off today.
It's our first time working together, just the two of us.
Yeah. Let's do a good job, Su-chan.
Okay.
Let's work hard, okay?
Yeah.
That's right! I have to work hard.
Welcome!
Because I have a dream.
Thank you very much!
Oh, I know! I should make a rice omelet today.
Shio-chan loves that.
What are you doing?
Man, now I'm all wet. How are you going to fix this?
Pretty sure it was your fault.
Bring me the manager!
Well--
Master!
I'm terribly sorry about that.
Are you hurt at all?
Excuse me.
I'll clean it right up.
It's okay.
By the way, sir...
This is a non-smoking establishment.
Oh, is it?
Sorry!
No problem. Thank you for your understanding!
CURE A CUTE
Satou, you're amazing.
You're super pretty, and you can handle any situation.
I wish I could be as perfect as you.
I'm not that perfect.
I made a mistake the other day and things turned out really bad.
Right. I almost lost what's important to me.
So, I'm not going to make the same mistake again.
I'm going to face everything with all I've got.
Then you really are amazing!
Satou, I've always admired you.
Ever since we first talked at work,
I've never stopped watching you.
I always wondered why you're so amazing, and what you're made of.
Hey, Satou, how were you made?
What is it, Mitori?
Satou's house?
She's popular. She's had a few stalkers before.
She may just not want people knowing her address.
Yes. I've been there once before.
But, no one answered when I rang the doorbell.
Even though it seemed like someone was home.
So you were the one who opened my locker and looked inside.
I've always hated myself.
I'm so plain and clumsy.
Nothing ever goes right in my life.
That's why I want to be like you, Satou!
I went through a lot for this bag!
I looked for the same things you had and bought them.
What I couldn't find, I made myself.
I'm even using the same makeup.
I copied the way you wear it too.
I work the same shifts, and I have the same handkerchief, socks and underwear.
But it's still not enough.
I can't go to the same school as you.
And our hairstyles...
My hair is still too short.
And I don't know what my dream is.
So I thought I'd at least try to have the same home environment as you.
That's why I read through your résumé.
But, it looks like no one lives at the address you wrote.
Satou, are you keeping where you live a secret?
Won't you tell me?
-If you're not hiding anything, you can tell me, right? -Satou-chan...
-I want to know everything about you! -Satou-chan...
Because I love you!
This is also love.
Shut up!
-Satou. -Satou-chan...
-Shut up! -I won't tell a soul.
-Satou-chan... -Shut up!
-Satou! -Satou-chan...
It's so bitter...
Shut up.
Shut up!
Satou--
Su-chan, your fingers are so thin and cute.
You're so small and skinny.
You feel so soft when I hug you.
It's because you're you that I love you.
Love? No way! There's no way!
There's no way you'd love me!
Why not? I think it's cute how you say that too.
No way! I--
I'm no good, and I'm defiant.
There's no way someone would love me.
That's why I'm going to try hard to be just like you!
I won't be able to love you if you do that.
You're wonderful the way you are right now, Su-chan.
The way you were born. You don't have to try hard to be anything.
You don't ever have to grow up.
Even if you're not so sharp, you're fine the way you are.
I'll be the only one who loves you.
You're so unfair, Satou.
I can't...
I can't say no to something that makes me so happy!
I surprised you, didn't I?
It's okay.
Satou!
But, Su-chan...
Don't ever pry into my life ever again.
I'm kind of mad.
I'm sorry.
Don't hate me!
I'll do anything you tell me to!
This is also love, Satou-chan.
Auntie.
Your words...
still echo within me.
It's still bitter.
It's because I told such a dirty lie.
I can't leave things like this.
Or else I'll...
Shio-chan!
Shio-chan!
I want something sweet!
Shio-chan! Where are you? Shio-chan!
Or else I'll...
Shio-chan?
Shio-chan...
5th Life: The Taste of Crime and the Taste of Punishment
So is this...
Mitsuboshi's house?
Taiyo?
Your friend from work is here to visit you.
Oh, it sounds like he's in the bathroom.
Can you wait a little?
I'll make some tea.
Sure.
His mom seems really nice.
I wish I had been born
into a family like this too.
MISSING SHIO KOUBE
Taiyo?
I'm okay, Mom!
We're going to talk in my room...
so you stay downstairs.
Hey. What's "family"?
Like my mom and my dad?
The people I care about who are always with me?
Spinning... Spinning...
Hey. Look at this!
Shio, I told you not to go outside!
S-- Sorry...
Spinning...
I'm so lonely I can't move.
I can't breathe.
Is this "family"?
Shio-chan! Shio-chan, hang in there!
Shio-chan, does it hurt? Are you in pain?
Punishment...
This is my punishment.
Satou-chan, I'm sorry.
I lied to you.
Lied?
I...
talked to someone else...
just a little bit that one night.
So God must be angry at me.
Because I betrayed you.
Shio-chan!
I did something wrong again.
I...
I have to say something! But...
It's bitter...
It's bitter! It's bitter! It's bitter!
I can't think straight.
Why is this so...?
Why...?
Punishment.
Is this my punishment?
But punishment for what?
Is it because I did something wrong?
I don't know why!
You came to visit me?
Thank you. I'm sorry I didn't call you earlier.
-No problem. -Sorry my room's a mess.
No problem.
Can you look out the window for a bit? I'll clean up.
Okay.
Don't step on my angel!
What is this guy talking about?
Who is that girl?
An angel.
She's the angel who purified me.
I received divine punishment that day because I tried to keep her to myself.
What can my filthy self do in order to see her again?
How can I become pure?
I thought about it, but I couldn't think of anything except her.
When I'm surrounded by her like this,
I feel like...
I'm becoming clean.
Taiyo! There, there!
There, there!
I don't get what you're saying.
S-- Sorry, Mitsuboshi! I'm going home!
If you're quitting, just let us know. That's all.
Has Matsuzaka been coming to work?
Does Matsuzaka have any family?
Does she live with her parents?
-I heard she lives alone with her aunt. -Really?
Does she really live alone with her aunt?
I saw her.
I saw her take this girl with her.
Maybe Matsuzaka kidnapped this girl.
If that's the case, we can't forgive her, right?
Matsuzaka is doing something unforgivable.
I've done whatever it took to protect my life with Shio-chan.
I thought it was okay to do anything
if it was for my one and only love.
But that wasn't true.
I had it wrong.
Satou-chan...
Is this your love?
Does it hurt this much?
And make you nauseous?
And make you keep crying?
Is this the one and only love...
you've been searching for all along?
What are you saying? Satou would never do something like that!
What reason would Satou have to kidnap someone?
Obviously...
it's so she can keep the angel all to herself!
Hida!
Help me!
Help me get her back!
-Let go of me! -I beg you!
She might be hurting her!
-Stop it! -She might be crying! I have to save her!
-With my own hands! -That hurts!
-I'm sure that'd make her smile at--! -I said, stop it!
-H--Hida! -Don't touch me, you idiot!
You idiot!
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! What's his problem? You disgusting idiot! Even though you're hot!
MISSING SHIO KOUBE
What is this?
What's going on? Satou!
Shio-chan, I'm sorry.
I committed a crime too.
Did you do something bad too?
I'm going to tell you everything.
My crime...
I...
I...
My voice is gone.
Can I really say this? It's just...
If she finds out what I did... What if Shio-chan starts to hate me?
I might lose her.
My one and only love!
Satou-chan! Satou-chan!
Satou-chan!
I'm scared.
I can't look into Shio-chan's eyes.
That's right.
If I lie...
If I pretend, so that no one finds out...
No.
I have to confess my crime.
Or else this bitter punishment
will never go away!
You know...
Shio-chan...
Please...
Don't...
abandon me!
I...
told someone else that I love them.
Even though I promised you...
I promised that...
I'd love you forever!
Lie or not, I told someone else that I love them!
I betrayed my love for you.
I betrayed my promise!
Sorry, Shio-chan! I'm sorry!
You're the one I love the most!
So much that I don't need anything else.
You're the guiding light for my love.
My one and only...
My...
Satou-chan, there, there.
Don't cry.
You know...
I love you too, Satou-chan.
Shio-chan...
You'll forgive me?
I know...
that you work hard for me.
So it's okay.
It's okay because it's you!
Shio-chan...
What?
I love you.
Me too!
I love you more than anything and anyone
and even more than my family!
You're warmer and happier than my family!
It's sweet!
-Satou-chan, I'm sorry I lied too-- -It doesn't matter!
Thank you, Shio-chan.
Satou-chan!
Through happiness and sadness,
until death do us part,
I promise to love you, Satou-chan.
Even if it's for love,
it's wrong to deceive the people we love.
It's wrong to lie about love.
So...
there's no need for me to tell Shio-chan about that.
Because...
Because it's not a crime.
Right, God?
I'll never let it cloud up again.
My dear, precious...
happy sugar life!
Satou would never kidnap anyone.
Never.
Mitsuboshi is crazy.
It looked like the devil to me.
It looked like a monster to me.
-Because it was too scary. -Because it was too kind.
6th Life:
"We Revolve Around the Moon."
There once was a little girl.
The girl's parents passed away when she was young.
She grew up without experiencing the love that develops between people.
"I want to know true love."
The girl tried to find love with lots of guys.
However, none of them were able to steal her heart.
She searched and searched.
She got hurt, but kept searching.
The girl finally found her one and only love.
However, her only family said:
"That's not love.
I'll never forgive you.
It's not normal."
The girl, angry that her love was criticized,
killed her aunt.
That's my imagination.
But I don't think I'm that far from the truth.
What is the truth?
Is it that?
Or something else?
I can't forgive her.
I'm the only one who should know your secret.
Right, Matsuzaka?
Are you calling home?
Oh, yeah. Something like that.
I didn't know you lived around here.
Yeah. It's close to where I work.
It's good to live somewhere convenient.
It keeps me motivated.
You live an hour away, right?
Yeah. It does take an hour.
Well, that was on purpose though.
I had a hard time at home and at school.
I always felt my heart was tied up.
But I felt different when I was with you.
I was able to be my real self.
That had never happened to me before.
Right now, I feel really liberated.
I'm glad I work where I do now.
Because I met you.
Thanks, Satou.
Me too.
I like talking to you.
I can relax.
And I'm happier now.
I was able to forget the unpleasant memories.
I thought, "Friends are great!"
We get along well.
I'm glad I met you too.
-Shoko-chan? -Don't make me cry.
I'm really glad I worked up the courage.
Shoko-chan, you're so cute.
You're the one who's cute!
Hida!
You're going to Matsuzaka's house? How--?
No, it's too dangerous!
My Shio-chan!
This is it. This apartment.
What? Isn't this...?
You live here, Satou?
And your lover?
But no one answered when I rang the doorbell.
I'm sure of it.
I've been here before.
Do you live here?
The police?
Someone reported a strange smell coming from this room.
No one answered when we rang the doorbell.
May we look inside?
The perfect place for cutting up a body.
Her own apartment.
That bag of trash Matsuzaka asked me to dispose of...
I bet her missing aunt was inside.
If so,
there's a good chance there are traces left inside her apartment.
Matsuzaka...
I won't let you...
share our secret with anyone else.
If you do,
I'll tell everyone!
But we're talking about Matsuzaka,
and she might be able to dodge this smoothly.
Right now isn't convenient for me.
There's been a report. We have to check.
Will you please cooperate?
Okay.
No way.
No way. No way...
That look on your face...
Are you for real?
Are you so panicked that you can't come up with a cover?
So does that mean
there's something in your apartment that'll get you in trouble?
This is bad. Hold it in. Hold it in...
She'll hear!
What's happening?
The same Matsuzaka who looked down on me, stepped on me, and scolded me...
I brought...
her secret...
to light!
Right now,
you must be desperately thinking about how to get out of this situation.
This is bad, right?
If they find any traces,
I don't know what will happen to me since I threw it away.
But I want to see this.
I want to see this! I want to see this!
I want to see her panic!
That's the only thing that'll bring me ecstasy!
I'll think about...
everything else later!
Matsuzaka!
Hey, Satou.
What was that just now?
I'm home.
It's me.
7TH LIFE: WHAT THE SUGAR GIRL IS MADE OUT OF
Who are you?
Me?
I'm her
I'm Satou's aunt.
No way!
Then what was in that trash bag?
I don't understand.
What is going on?
This is my sign for...
calling her.
We rang the doorbell several times.
Can we talk to you right now?
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't notice.
What do you want to talk about?
Well...
Someone reported a strange smell coming from this room.
We want to look inside.
Are you with the police?
Yes.
That must be a hard job.
But there's nothing inside this apartment.
We want to check.
Check?
Come inside.
Excuse me.
Satou's aunt?
Who are you?
Oh, yeah, nice to meet you!
I'm Shoko Hida.
I'm her friend from work.
You come inside too.
Satou-chan, don't just stand there.
Wait!
What? It's--
This place...
It's dark.
It's not even night yet.
Come inside.
Okay.
Why does it feel so damp?
And it smells kind of weird...
I don't want to stay here long.
How was it?
I didn't find anything dangerous.
And no one else is here.
Where haven't we looked yet?
Satou...
Excuse me.
What about this room? It's locked.
Oh, yes.
There's trash in that room.
I thought the smell might go away if I locked it.
Can you open it?
No.
It smells, you know!
It'll make me gag! So I don't want to.
Can you open it?
-Probably. -What?
Wait! I said no!
Excuse me. Stay back.
Excuse me.
-No-- -Stay back.
It opened.
See?
We'll check here too.
Go ahead.
Watch your feet.
Hey, Satou.
Is this really...
where you live?
That's right.
There was nothing wrong in particular.
But... That room...
Yes. I'll clean up.
Please do that.
That might be the cause of the smell.
And it's not sanitary.
It isn't a good environment for a child.
Why are you laughing?
It's nothing. Sorry.
You know...
I just thought being a policeman was a tough job.
Hey, policeman.
How many days have you gone without?
Poor thing.
Don't you ever comfort yourself?
Hey. Let me go.
-I knew it. -Stop.
You've always wanted to be a policeman ever since you were a kid.
You were always studying and never played.
You didn't criticize the dirty room and went in anyway.
You do lots of busy-work.
You're a hard-working, good boy.
But sometimes you get lonely.
That's why sometimes you wonder if you're a boring person.
Being hard-working is your only strength.
You have nothing else.
You're a boring person.
You!
Kose!
Go ahead. Hit me.
Hit me, and you'll feel better.
Hey.
You don't have to hold back.
It'll make you feel really good.
Hit my face as hard as you can,
punch me in the stomach, and yell at me.
And then rip off my clothes,
and do whatever you want to me.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
It's who you really are,
and it's the most important part of your heart.
I'll love you, even if that's the way you are.
You can use me as your outlet.
See?
You're a good boy.
Forget about the world outside.
You can suck on them.
You can act like a little kid,
or you can be violent.
You can do anything you want to me.
It's okay.
I don't care what you do.
I'll swallow up any desire.
That's what love is.
See? Only me...
What are you doing?
You're lonely too, aren't you?
If you're lonely, I'll accept you anytime.
No, thank you.
Let's go.
Don't hold back!
I'll always...
be here.
What?
You look a little lonely too.
Are you starving for love?
That's right.
I hope you find your one and only prince.
You never do change, Aunt.
Her voice is kind.
But her voice is also creepy and sticks in my head.
Hey, Satou! Who is she?
I know she's your aunt, but...
But...
She's weird!
She acted out like that so suddenly...
talking about love...
I'm sorry.
To her, that's love.
She accepts all people's desires.
Violence, sex, anything and everything.
She feels happy accepting those things from others.
I was raised by her.
We're related by blood.
Shoko-chan,
will you still be my friend?
Satou...
you're the only friend I have who I can talk to about what I really feel.
Shoko-chan.
Stupid Satou!
Of course!
Sorry, Shoko-chan.
Sorry to surprise you.
Forget everything.
Let's be friends from work again tomorrow, like always.
No, Satou.
I want to face you.
If you're hurting, I want to help you.
Satou! I...
I didn't know...
that my half-hearted courage...
could hurt others so badly.
Hey, Satou.
Your aunt is weird.
Hey.
Maybe you're weird too.
I remembered something painful again after a long time.
It was always like that.
But it doesn't matter anymore.
That's how it is.
So stop following me and trying to pry into my life.
Teacher.
Then what was in that bag?
An obedient dog should go straight home
and have his wife tell him, "Good boy!"
Or else,
I'll never give you a treat ever again.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay! Good boy!
Goodbye!
Satou-chan! Welcome back!
I'm home, Shio-chan!
Hey, Shio-chan.
Do you know what a friend is?
Friend?
Friend? Friend?
I don't know! What's a friend?
I don't really know either.
What is a friend?
You're weird, Satou-chan!
I don't care.
As long as Shio-chan is with me.
That's enough for me.
It's nothing.
Why?
It's because I don't want to go home.
Hey.
You're letting me stay. I'll pay you back.
What do you want me to do?
Model for your art?
Hey...
Do you know what love is?
I wanted to know what love was and feel satisfied.
Hey, does it exist?
Love that isn't overbearing?
"8th Life: Apartment No. 1208"
There you are!
I'm Mitsuboshi. I called earlier.
You're Asahi Koube, right?
Nice to meet you.
I told you over the phone. I found a clue related to your flyers
-while I was traveling. -Traveling?
It was at Yokoshina station.
It's far, but you can get there without changing trains.
It's not impossible.
What's your clue?
Hold on!
Shio... Shio...
Shio!
SHIO KOUBE
Someone had turned that in to the station.
I thought there might be
a connection with the girl in the flyer.
Am I right?
But she's been missing for three months now, right?
The most likely explanation
is that someone lured her and took her somewhere.
In that case, that person would try to run far away
instead of staying around here.
Your odds of finding her are better there than here.
He's right.
This is real. It's Mom's handwriting.
This is definitely Shio's.
This is my first clue!
This guy's story makes sense.
But there's still something holding me back.
Why? Why?
Think! Think! Think!
Hey. I can help you.
-So-- -Wait!
-Can I ask you something? -Okay.
How did you know I was the person you called just by looking at me?
What are you talking about?
We met each other before, right?
I saved you when those thugs were bothering you.
-No! -Huh?
Then why didn't you say that earlier?
You didn't say anything about that until now.
That's weird! Something's off!
You're hiding something.
You're trying to trick me.
This is just a game for you, right?
You smell like a dirty grown-up!
You smell like a dirty, lying, hopeless hypocrite of an adult!
I'm nothing like that woman!
I'm nothing like that woman...
Stop saying I'm like that dirty woman!
No! I'm not like her!
Wait!
Shio...
Shio... Shio...
Shio... Shio!
I'm an idiot.
That guy
is my real clue for finding Shio!
He's gone.
He's gone.
He's gone.
There are lots of threads.
I finally found a real one.
I should be happy.
But my heart feels like it's about to be crushed.
If I pull this thread, I might find the answer.
Shio might not be alive anymore...
It's like I'm walking towards the edge of a cliff.
The further I go, the more scared I get.
But even so, I can't let go of this thread.
No matter what the answer is...
I won't give up!
My biggest fear is not being able to find her.
So I'm going to find her! No matter what!
Shio...
How did it go?
I found a clue.
Who gave you the clue?
I don't know his name or his address.
All I know is that he was a young blond guy.
He looked like a hard-working guy.
Did he wear a hairpin?
Yeah.
Do you know him?
Sorry. I don't know.
But I don't think you should listen to him.
We're not even sure if that's true or not.
I'm going to go anyway.
Thanks for everything.
You're a good person.
I'm forever in your debt.
I think we'll never see each other again.
Take care.
Bye.
Why don't you just stop?
You look like you're in a lot of pain.
You should take care of yourself more!
You can't live on without feeling any happiness.
Can't you find happiness yourself first?
No.
This is the only kind of happiness I know.
They say there are many types of happiness.
But I can't understand. I can't imagine it.
Living together with my mom and Shio is my happiness.
Everything else is meaningless!
So I'm going to get Shio back for my happiness!
And I have to tell Shio not to turn out like me! That's why--
Sorry...
Sorry.
Sorry for saying something so mean.
I might be broken already.
That's not true!
You're amazing.
You really care about others.
You're shaking...
You're scared, but you're still moving forward.
You're amazing!
I hate it too.
I hate staying in the darkness and having regrets.
Yeah. I hate it.
Oh. Don't cry!
There, there.
Hey. You have a phone, right?
-Let's exchange numbers. -Huh?
Come on! I'll message you, okay?
I'm sure
there's light at the end of your journey.
So promise me
that you're going to smile at the end. Okay?
Oh, man.
I wonder why...
I'm jealous of her.
You're really weak and not very manly.
And you're not my type.
But I wish you were my prince.
Just kidding.
You look terrible.
9TH LIFE: DISSOLVING RAIN
I said everything I was supposed to.
I'm not sure whether he believed me, though.
I think he's suspicious.
Yeah. I got it.
I'll do what you tell me to, Matsuzaka.
So when are you going to let me see Shio-chan?
I see.
I'll do my best. Tell her I said hi.
I want Shio-chan to purify me soon!
Let's do this!
I knew it.
I knew he'd take the first train.
I'm glad I took action now.
The world outside is filled with impurities.
People I hate.
People in my way.
Liars.
Dirty people.
I need to eliminate all risks.
I was always alone.
Always numb.
Something was always missing.
I was always sad.
I thought I would end up dying alone.
But I was wrong.
Shio-chan found me and proved me wrong!
That's right!
The sky is sparkling.
Today's our anniversary!
An anniversary for celebrating the day I eliminated that thing!
Thank you!
I'm back!
Huh? Satou-chan, where did you go?
I smell something sweet!
Did you bring something?
Huh? I wonder what it is...
Hey! No keeping secrets!
You're a bad girl!
Wait! Shio-chan!
No... No, Shio-chan!
We're going to spend all day together today!
Really? Yay!
Mille-feuille, Charlotte,
black forest, Sachertorte and tiramisu.
Satou-chan, what's the occasion?
It's a tiny celebration.
This one's amazing! Black forest?
Sweet and soft! Black forest!
There are lots of different kinds of cake!
They're all sweet, but they're all a little different!
Satou-chan, cake is mysterious!
It's sweet, it's sweet...
Hey. Let's split them in half.
Are you sure?
I have to protect this life.
I want to eat them together!
This is where I belong.
Hey, Satou-chan.
Is it good?
Yup!
I'm going to protect her, no matter what!
It's really good!
In this sweet, gentle and pure castle.
-Hey, Satou-chan. -Hmm?
-Who made those cakes just now? -Huh?
Um...
Maybe it was someone at the bakery.
-Think I could bake them too? -Huh?
Satou-chan, you like cake, right?
But it won't happen anytime soon...
I've never cooked.
But I'll work hard!
I want to bake a cake for you someday
and make you smile!
-Someday? -Yeah! Someday.
From now... From here on...
Tomorrow... Next year... The future...
Huh?
What is this feeling?
Satou-chan?
I've never thought about the future until now.
It was sort of... You know...
My life didn't have any taste.
My days weren't even rusty.
They were meaningless.
But it's different now.
What should I do? I've never felt like this before!
It's fun to think about the future with you!
That's right!
I want to share every moment with you!
Forever and ever!
-Let's have a wedding! -Huh?
A wedding is a promise that you'll be together forever.
I heard about it.
So let's promise.
We'll be together forever! Okay?
I promise!
Let' have a wedding right now!
Let's get a veil and flowers!
Okay! Okay!
-I'll be right back, okay? -Okay!
Satou-chan, I love you!
I'm so happy right now!
Oh, Shio-chan.
Satou!
The little bird was abandoned by the girl,
and sunk to the ground
in loneliness.
However, as if by instinct,
she flew again.
The little bird tried to reach her heart.
The bird sang to her heart.
Her song
melted into the sound of the rain.
But she still sang.
She sang.
She sang.
She sang.
A gentle song.
The little bird won't give up anymore.
She's tired of giving up.
All that's left is to give it a try.
The cute little chick.
A cry-baby and a brave singing bird.
Face me! I'm sure we'll understand each other.
It's no use, Shoko-chan.
I don't feel anything for you at all.
You're no different from everyone else.
I don't care! Even if you're the devil,
I still love you!
I'll bring you back to the light!
Satou!
Hey.
Did you really think I'd buy your lie
that you're not telling the police?
You rejected me
that one time, remember?
How am I
supposed to believe a girl like that?
So...
Sorry.
Satou-chan?
The reason I can't hear the bird anymore
isn't because of the rain.
Satou-chan, did you really do it for me?
Are your eyes on me?
Or on yourself?
10th Life: A Proposal under a Starry Sky.
Satou-chan. Good girl.
It looks like there's nothing left in Satou-chan anymore.
I wonder what happened.
I wonder if that girl
did something to her.
But she's not here anymore.
What should I do?
I've never seen her like this before.
Satou-chan.
Satou-chan! Satou-chan! Satou-chan!
Satou-chan!
She must be exhausted.
She's always protecting me,
even though this place is a castle
for both of us.
All right!
I'll take care of the house for Satou-chan!
Here it is!
Satou-chan's "I'll do it my way" curry!
Eggplant, pumpkin, meat,
and bell peppers!
It's delicious because it has lots of different things!
The kids are useless because of you!
Why don't you go earn some money, damn it!
That's what you get for being slow.
Someone once said, "a person's heart is like a jar."
You can stuff lots of things inside,
but when it breaks, that person breaks too.
-Mom! -No, Shio.
Don't touch!
It's dangerous.
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.
Pon! Pon! Pon! Pon!
I have to tidy up before dinner!
Pon! Pon!
But it's not very dusty.
Huh?
It's dirty.
Let's wipe it up!
Good!
It's clean now!
Isn't it pretty?
This is the only thing
I received from your grandmother and grandfather.
But I don't know how to put it on.
So I've never worn it before.
It would look good on you, Shio.
I can do your makeup and tie up your hair.
I want to take pictures of you in this kimono when you get married.
Hey.
Stop blabbing.
Hurry up and sell that junk.
I'll be okay. I just have to put up with this
until he dies someday. I'm not alone.
I've got the support. I'll work hard.
My cute kids. Smile, I'll stay and protect you.
We'll live a happy life.
No, he hits me! I'm bleeding. It hurts.
I'm sad! No one's there! I threw it all away.
Mom, Dad, I'm sorry! It's my fault! I didn't know!
He's the devil. I've been abandoned!
This is hell! I can't escape!
It's so dark!
What should I do?
I've never used this before.
But I remember
Satou-chan puts her laundry inside, and--
Mom, look at this!
Did you go outside, Shio?
I told you not to go see anyone!
I didn't see anyone.
You don't understand
how dangerous and scary it is outside!
Everything turned out wrong because of you!
And we ran out of money.
I can't take it anymore.
-It's all... -Sorry.
Sorry, Mom.
No.
I'm sorry I'm so stupid.
It's all my fault.
Sorry.
Good girl. Good girl.
Pain, pain,
go away!
Thanks, Shio.
I felt like I had many moms.
A scary one, a sad one,
and a kind one.
It'll be okay!
He'll come for us someday.
Then everything will be all right.
No... If we don't do something, you're going to break!
Where is it?
Where is the thing that can fix this jar?
Mom!
I want to go outside!
Take me!
What?
I'll be fine as long as I'm with you!
Please!
Okay. Just don't let go of my hand.
Shio, is there somewhere you want to go?
You're right.
Staying inside all the time is no fun.
There's so many people and so many things!
There must be something here.
Something that can fix your jar!
Mom, you'll be fine!
I'll make everything okay!
That's right! We can replace it!
Mom! Look at that!
Shio!
I want to make you smile, Mom!
Shio! You can't go outside ever again!
Stay here forever and keep quiet.
Forever!
No!
You're going to break!
Stop saying things that don't make sense!
Why don't you ever listen to me?
I didn't do anything! But you just--
Don't do anything ever again!
If you don't do anything, nothing will ever happen!
That's no good!
Hey!
No!
Shio.
Let's go.
Mom, where are we going?
Hey, Mom!
Mom!
Goodbye, Shio.
No!
Mom! No!
Don't leave me! Sorry!
I'll do what you tell me!
I won't act on my own!
Sorry, Mom!
-Sorry! -No.
I don't need you anymore.
I should have done this earlier.
Goodbye, Shio.
Goodbye.
10TH LIFE: A PROPOSAL UNDER A STARRY SKY
I'm not lonely.
I have Satou-chan, so I'm fine.
You too, Satou-chan, right?
You cried when I wasn't here.
You said you love me.
So we have to stay together forever.
Because we're incomplete.
There was always something missing, and it hurts.
It hurts?
I see!
I was hurting this whole time.
Satou-chan?
Where do you want to go?
Where?
Yeah. For example, how about up north?
It's cold, but the food is good.
It's nice in the west too.
I want to try living on an island.
It seems relaxing.
Maybe it's better to live among lots of old people
in the countryside.
It would be nice to grow food in our garden.
-As long as I'm with you-- -Satou-chan.
Are you abandoning the castle?
You said so before, right?
This place is a castle for us to live happily ever after.
As long as we're here, there's nothing to be scared of.
So that's not true anymore?
Hey, Satou-chan!
I could work really hard too.
I'm going to work hard with you!
Okay?
Wait!
Here! Curry!
It's delicious since we let it sit!
Let's eat delicious food and get better! Let's smile!
Here. Here.
Here. Here.
It'll be okay, Shio-chan.
Sorry to make you worry.
This castle is going to crumble soon.
Something dirty came in.
So we're going outside.
I know that you're afraid of the outside world.
But don't worry, you'll be with me.
I'll protect you, Shio-chan.
I'll protect you from all the scary and dirty things.
So you don't have to do anything.
Don't worry about anything.
Just call my name like you always do,
and smile.
That's enough to keep me going.
As long as I'm with Shio-chan, I can do anything.
As long as I have love...
The pieces of love that rain down from you...
I--
Why are you always like that?
What am I to you?
What am I to you, Satou-chan?
S-Shio-chan?
I love you more than anyone else in the world.
Liar!
You have lots of secrets!
You never tell me anything important!
That's not right!
Shio-chan.
There are lots of things you don't need to know.
That's why I don't tell you.
You just have to stay with me.
That's all I need to feel better.
So that means I don't have to do anything?
That's right! Shio-chan,
all you have to do is stay with me and smile!
Then, you don't need me here, right?
I'd be just like a doll.
Shio-chan!
What?
"You don't need me here"? What do you mean?
Why? That's impossible!
Shio-chan! Shio-chan, where are you?
She hasn't gone outside.
Shio-chan.
You're in there, right?
Thanks.
You took care of lots of things when I wasn't feeling well.
I was really happy.
But I also felt bad about it.
-You had to work hard because of me. -Hurry.
-Hurry up and come out! -I'm sorry to make you do that.
But it'll be fine now.
I'll never fall apart.
I'm going to fight for you, Shio-chan. Okay?
No! No! No! No!
I don't want to be with you.
I hate you, Satou-chan!
Why? Why? Why?
Did I do something wrong? What did I do?
Huh?
I can't think about anything else after what she said.
It's spinning...
Her words are spinning
through my body, through my veins.
My heart...
My brain is going to overflow.
-Why? -I can't stop shaking.
I don't have enough sugar.
I can't think.
I feel sick.
I'm going to become stupid. This feeling...
Is this
despair?
There's no meaning.
I have no reason to exist if Shio-chan doesn't want me.
I can't do anything alone.
I can only go on if I'm with you.
I don't want to be alone.
Shio-chan!
I don't want to be alone!
She's leaving. Aren't you going to chase after her?
No.
Her jar is going to break if I'm there.
I know that now. So it's okay.
Is that love?
Love?
Caring about someone,
and feeling drawn to them.
That's what they call love.
I...
I wanted her to live
so that I could keep living too.
So it wasn't...
It wasn't love...
Your jar is empty,
but it's not broken.
You believe in something.
That's why it doesn't break.
I hope it fills up.
That emptiness.
With something that sparkles.
That's right. Satou-chan.
I don't want to be alone either.
That's why I was really happy to be with you.
But you didn't feel the same way.
You're always working hard alone.
I always felt you were looking at something really far away.
Satou-chan.
I don't want to just smile and call your name anymore.
I worry about you.
I want to do what I can. I'm going to do it.
Because this is about you.
So let's fight together.
I want to protect you too, Satou-chan.
It hurts to see you get hurt.
We're one and the same!
So protect me, Satou-chan!
I'm going to protect you too.
When we die,
I'll be your partner in crime.
My senses are coming back.
The sugar is filling me up.
I'm so happy to be alive!
Is it really okay to feel this happy?
Shio-chan.
I killed someone.
So we have to leave this place.
Deceiving, hurting, and stealing from people...
That's what I did this whole time.
Thanks, Shio-chan. Let's fight and put our lives on the line!
Let's prove our love together!
Okay!
Wherever you are, that's where my happy sugar life is too.
Sorry I said I hate you,
Satou-chan.
Good night.
I feel like we spent a lot of time here.
But it was much shorter
than the time I spent with my mom.
That's so weird.
I'm sad, but I also feel warm.
Maybe it's because I know I have Satou-chan.
Wow! The stars are so beautiful!
I'll be okay! It's scary outside,
but it's different this time.
Satou-chan is different from my mom.
I want to be with Satou-chan!
That's what makes me feel the happiest!
So please, God!
Don't take it from me!
Don't take away my life with Satou-chan!
I don't need anything else!
I don't need you anymore, Mom!
Don't say that, Shio!
Who was that?
Shio doesn't know
about Mom.
About what happened that day.
That's why...
I have to tell her.
Instead of loving in order to live,
what if we could live and die in order to love?
11th Life: An Eternal Moment with You.
I put up with everything.
I believed that if I put up with the pain,
there'd be light at the end of the tunnel.
But, nothing changed.
The light just got farther away, and darkness still surrounds me.
Nothing changes.
I can't change anything.
That's why...
I'm going to stop now.
I can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave your name
and message after the tone.
ASAHI KOUBE
I FOUND SHIO. MEET AT THE PARK.
W-What's going on!?
Matsuzaka, what are you doing?
Didn't he leave for another city?
No! No! You're not the one who's getting Shio-chan!
I'm the one who's going to be
Shio-chan's knight!
Huh?
Why am I...
My head hurts...
Hi.
Be quiet. There's something I want to ask you.
This is the girl
who helped me with you, right?
So, you knew?
You gave me information about Shio even though you knew?
You're an accomplice?
If you make a scene, I'll beat you.
Her name is Satou Matsuzaka.
She's protecting Shio.
Or keeping her locked up.
Anyway, she's with Shio-chan.
But that's all I know!
I don't know where Matsuzaka is.
It's true! Please, believe me!
I lied to you
because she told me that if I did that,
she'd let me see Shio-chan.
That's right! You're looking for Shio-chan, right?
Let's work together and save Shio-chan!
I can talk to Matsuzaka.
If we work together, we can get Shio-chan back!
Now that's a good plan!
What are you talking about?
What makes you think you're worth that much?
You smell like a dirty adult.
I don't trust you anymore.
Get a hold of Matsuzaka's address at work.
You'll help me?
I’m not helping. I’m giving you an order.
I know that it hurts
when someone pushes hard on your nails.
The sharp pain of having your nail ripped off...
Then, a dull pain ensues and persists...
Oozing... Oozing...
The pain controls your mind.
Can you stand
that pain?
I got it! I got it!
Find her address and contact me.
-Go! -O-Okay.
When we die,
I'll be your partner in crime.
Thanks, Shio-chan.
I was happy when you said you'd fight together with me.
Thanks to you,
I was able to stand again.
Let's live together.
So we don't lose each other in the darkness,
let's keep shouting "I love you."
That's what I'm going to live for.
That reason only.
Oh... What happened?
Come on. Come inside.
Satou-chan, welcome.
Starting today, this is your new home.
Love...
Love... Love...
Love is different for every person.
The way it shines is different.
But anyone can receive it.
Once you experience it, your heart feels fulfilled in an instant.
I'm coming!
Welcome! I was waiting for you.
It'll be fine!
Love is something that can't be seen.
Love...
Auntie, you're hurt again.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
I'm okay.
This is also love.
There are many different flavors of love.
Strawberry, lemon, apple, and mint.
There are also poisonous ones.
Taste it. Swallow it.
As long as there's some in the jar.
When they run out, you add more.
Over and over again.
When I do that, I feel surrounded by love,
and I feel happy.
But, my heart still had a big hole in the middle
all along.
Auntie. Will you hear me out?
What is it?
I killed someone.
For someone I love.
I’ll destroy the evidence to pursue love,
and travel far away, just the two of us. Help us out.
Satou-chan, you're so amazing.
Are you calling the police?
No.
Some of the people that came here
also did things like that.
But I loved them too.
That's what my love is.
So, of course...
I love you too, Satou-chan!
But I'm not your one and only love, right?
You love everyone.
There’s no one you love the most.
I don't call that love.
I'm sure of it now.
Auntie.
Your love is wrong.
Ever since I was a child,
I wanted to experience love.
You can't see love.
I didn't know what it looked like.
But I finally know what it looks like now.
When I met her,
I felt fulfilled for the first time in my life.
It was like a piece of snow.
I held onto it, and tried to take care of it.
At times, I failed.
But still,
she continues to fulfills me.
It's strange.
It keeps changing.
I can't help but think
it's something sweeter than sugar.
It's priceless and special.
That's what my love is.
Oh. Good.
You found love.
I'm not going to criticize your love.
But you're still a kid.
A kid who can't take responsibility for herself.
You want to overstep your bounds?
Do it once you've grown up.
That's right. You're completely dependent on adults, after all.
You sponge off and cling onto them to live.
That's how it works, Satou-chan.
You can't pursue love alone.
That's the reality of things.
Don't worry, Satou-chan.
You'll grow up someday.
You'll grow up into a dirty adult in no time.
So,
keep acting like an innocent child.
Even if you can't get what you want,
you can still do your best.
That's all you can do.
You're just a cute kid.
You taught that kid the wrong idea about love.
That's why you have a responsibility to pay me back.
A responsibility to help me.
Take responsibility for doing this to me.
You're a dirty adult. Take responsibility, Auntie.
Responsibility, huh?
I've never thought about it before.
Okay, Satou-chan.
I'll help you.
Let me watch your love until the end.
And what happens to you in the end.
I'll come again.
Hey, Satou-chan.
You killed that little bird, right?
It's okay.
I won't do anything.
I'll help you.
I swear on my love.
But... I see...
She's gone now.
That's too bad.
11TH LIFE: AN ETERNAL MOMENT WITH YOU
Mitsuboshi! What a relief!
Sorry.
Sorry to make you worry.
I thought I'd say hi today.
I'm glad you came back.
Actually, we're in a tight spot.
Last night, Matsuzaka told us she can't come in for a while.
I thought I'd ask Shoko to work instead,
but I can't get a hold of her.
Sorry I can't help.
It’s not your fault.
We'll get through this today.
You're more than welcome to start tomorrow.
-Okay. -Thanks.
There it is! This is it!
DEAR HOMES APT. 305
This is good.
Hida...
They can't get a hold of her?
Stop. I don't have time to think about it now.
I’m not helping.
I’m giving you an order.
That's right.
I don't have to take orders from you!
-Shio-chan, are you scared of cars? -A little.
It'll be fine.
-I'll hold your hand. -Okay.
Satou-chan! Thanks for waiting!
Auntie, that was dangerous.
Can you really drive?
It'll be fine! Oh!
So, you're Satou-chan's love.
You're so small and cute!
I'm Satou-chan's aunt. Nice to meet you!
I'm Shio Koube!
I've been together with Satou-chan!
Nice to meet you!
Shio-chan. She's kind of weird.
Don't talk to her too much.
Huh? But she's your aunt, right?
I want to be friends!
Shio-chan!
Oh, Satou-chan!
You look so cute when you're with the person you love!
Well then, let's go!
HOME CENTER WINTER
My crimes are all in that room.
That's why I want to erase them without a trace.
Good idea.
Kose... Remember that policeman?
I asked him about it.
But no one has reported
that anything happened to the little bird yet.
After I take care of this,
I plan to go somewhere where no one knows us.
We're going to live together in a new place.
What a nice honeymoon!
We have to buy time until we can escape completely.
So, our story is that I'm the one who died in that room.
I'm not at home right now.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey! What's taking you so long? Hurry up and call me back!
Shio-chan's on the other side of this door!
Shio-chan's right here!
Just thinking about it
makes my body shiver in pleasure!
Shio-chan's voice, her smell...
I can experience them again!
Shio-chan!
I've come for you!
Shio-chan?
Shio-chan? Where are you?
This isn't Shio-chan's sweet smell...
Oh...
Are you starving for love too?
I hope today will be the start of a good journey.
Let's make a vow.
An eternal vow.
Shio-chan!
Yeah. Let's begin.
Our vows.
In sickness
and in health,
through happiness
and sadness,
for richer,
for poorer...
until death do us part...
I wish to stay connected with you forever, Shio-chan.
I wish to be together with you forever, Satou-chan.
This is a symbol of our love.
I vow that I love you, Shio-chan.
I vow that
I love you, Satou-chan.
Tomorrow, we'll leave this place and find a new castle.
But, I don't need a castle.
As long as you're with me, that's enough for me!
I'd do anything for you, Shio-chan.
I can feel the hole in my heart
filling up.
This love
is forever.
Satou-chan!
Shio-chan!
Satou-chan!
Shio-chan!
12th Life: Happy Sugar Life.
