## Understanding Matrix-Vector Mulplication

$$
A \boldsymbol{x}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
{a_{11}} & {a_{11}} & {\cdots} & {a_{1 n}} \\
{a_{21}} & {a_{22}} & {\cdots} & {a_{2 n}} \\
{\vdots} & {\vdots} & {\ddots} & {\vdots} \\
{a_{m 1}} & {a_{m 2}} & {\cdots} & {a_{m n}}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
{x_{1}} \\
{x_{2}} \\
{\vdots} \\
{x_{n}}
\end{array}\right]
$$

There are two different equivalent representations of matrix-vector multiplication. The first one is 

$$
A\boldsymbol{x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
{\boldsymbol{a}^{(1)} \boldsymbol{x}} \\
{\boldsymbol{a}^{(2)}\boldsymbol{x}} \\
{\vdots} \\
{\boldsymbol{a}^{(m)} \boldsymbol{x}}
\end{array}\right]
$$

Where $\boldsymbol{a}^{(i)}$ is $i$th row vector of matrix $A$ and each $\boldsymbol{a}^{(i)}\boldsymbol{x}$ can be viewed as the **projection** from  input signal space to the kernel. 

The other interpretation is 

$$
A\boldsymbol{x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
{a_{11}} \\
{a_{21}} \\
{\vdots} \\
{a_{m 1}}
\end{array}\right] x_{1}+\left[\begin{array}{c}
{a_{12}} \\
{a_{22}} \\
{\vdots} \\
{a_{m 2}}
\end{array}\right] x_{2}+\ldots \ldots+\left[\begin{array}{c}
{a_{1 n}} \\
{a_{2 n}} \\
{\vdots} \\
{a_{m n}}
\end{array}\right] x_{n}
$$

This can be viewed as weighted sum of the columns of matrix $A$.

## Understanding 1D Convolution

In this part we will discuss convolution, since we would like to explore the sparsity, stationarity, compositionality of the data.

Instead of using the matrix $A$ above, we will change the matrix width to the kernel size $k$. Therefore, each row of the matrix is a kernel. We can use the kernels by stacking and shifting (see Fig 1). Then we can have $m$ layers of height $n-k+1$.

The output is $m$ (thickness) vectors of size $n-k+1$.

Furthermore, a single input vector can viewed as a monophonic signal.

</center>


Now, the input $x$ is a mapping

$$
x:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{c}
$$

where $\Omega=\{1,2,3,\dots\}\subset\mathbb{N}^1$ (since this is 1 dimentional signal in a 1 dimentional domain) and in this case channel number $c$ is $1$. And when $c=2$ this becomes a stereophonic system.

For the 1D convolution, we can just compute the scalar product layer by layer. (see Fig 4)

## Dimension of Kernels and Output Width in PyTorch

Tips: We can use ***question mark*** in IPython to get access to the documents of functions.

### 1D Convolution

We have 1 dimensional convolution going from 2 channels (stereophonic signal) to 16 channels (16 kernels) with kernel size of 3 and stride of 1. We then have 16 kernels with thickness 2 and length 3. Let's assume that the input signal has a batch of size 1 (one signal),  2 channels and 64 samples. The resulting output layer should have one signal, 16 channels and the length of the signal is 62 (=64-3+1). Also, if we output the bias size, we'll find the bias size is 16, since we have one bias per weight.

### 2D Convolution

We first define the input data as one sample, 20 channels with height 64 and width 128. 2D convolution has 20 channels from input and 16 kernels with size of 3 $\times$ 5. After convolution, the output data has one sample, 16 channels with height 62 (=64-3+1) and width 124 (=128-5+1).

If we want to achieve the same dimensionality, we can have paddings. Continuing the code above, we can add new parameters to the convolution function: stride=1 and padding=(1, 2) , which means 1 on $y$ direction (1 at the top and 1 at the bottom) and 2 on $x$ direction. Then the output signal is in the same size compared to the input signal. The number of dimensions that is required to store the collection of kernels when you perform 2D convolution is 4.

## How Automatic Gradient Works?

In this section we're going to ask torch to check all the computation over the tensors so that we can perform the computation of partial derivatives.  

- Create a 2 $\times$ 2 tensor $\boldsymbol{x}$ with gradient-accumulation capabilities
- Deduct 2 from all elements of $\boldsymbol{x}$ and get $\boldsymbol{y}$ (If we print ***y.grad_fn***, we will get *<SubBackward0 object at 0x12904b290>*, which means that y is generated by the module of subtraction $\boldsymbol{x}-2$. Also we can use ***y.grad_fn.next_functions\[0][0].variable*** to derive the original tensor.)
- Do more operations: $\boldsymbol{z} = 3\boldsymbol{y}^2$
- Calculate the mean of $\boldsymbol{z}$

Back propagation is used for computing the gradients. In this example, the process of back propagation can be viewed as computing the gradient $\frac{d\boldsymbol{a}}{d\boldsymbol{x}}$. After computing $\frac{d\boldsymbol{a}}{d\boldsymbol{x}}$ by hand as a validation, we can find that the execution of ***a.backward()*** gives us the same value of *x.grad* as our computation.

Whenever you use partial derivative in PyTorch, you get the same shape of the original data. But the correct Jacobian thing should be the transpose.

### From Basic to More Crazy

Now we have a 1 x 3 vector $x$, assign $y$ to the double $x$ and keep doubling $y$ until its norm is smaller than 1000. Due to the randomness we have for $x$, we can not directly know the number of iterations when the procedure terminates.

However, we can infer it easily by knowing the gradients we have.

As for the inference, we can use `requires_grad=True` to label that we want to track the gradient accumulation as shown below.

<center>
<img src="../05-3/Inference.png" alt="14" style="zoom:50%;" /><br>
<b>Fig 14</b>: Inference Example
</center>

And, we can have `with torch.no_grad()` to omit the gradient accumulation.

<center>

<b>Fig 15</b>: Inference Example: no_grad()
</center><br>

Also, we can have self-defined `forward` and `backward` functions to plug the partial gradients you calculate in the chain. As we observe from the three examples below, the `add`, `split` and `max` functions correspond to copy the both sides in addition, summation and the max to be 1 in gradients, respectively.
