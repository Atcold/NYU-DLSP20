## Lecture part A

We discussed three applications of convolutional neural networks. We started with digit recognition and the application to a 5-digit zip code recognition. In object detection, we talk about how to use multi-scale architecture in a face detection setting. Lastly, we saw how ConvNets are used in semantic segmentation tasks with concrete examples in a robotic vision system and object segmentation in an urban environment.
