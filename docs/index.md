title: Deep Learning (with PyTorch)
---

This course concerns the latest techniques in deep learning and
representation learning, focusing on supervised and unsupervised deep
learning, embedding methods, metric learning, convolutional net and
recurrent nets, with applications to computer vision, natural language
understanding, and speech recognition.  The prerequisites include: DS-GA
1001 Intro to Data Science or a graduate-level machine learning course.

## Lecture Notes

Students will **collaborate** on writing up and editing lecture and lab
notes in groups of 4 (3 writers + 1 editor) for every hour (50 min)
of class. This means **two groups of 4** per lecture and **one group
of 4** per lab. All 8 scribes per lecture submit one cohesive set of
notes in the form of Markdown source code. Similarly, 4 scribes per
lab submit one document. You may use [hackMD](https://hackmd.io/)
for generating the collaborative Markdown document; nevertheless, you
will have to submit a pull request with the finished document to the [main
repository](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-Deep-Learning-Minicourse/tree/master/docs/chapters)
(see the rendered notes at the class materials link
above). Sign up for scribe duties [here (sheet in this google
folder)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b7sx6laPYK62KoXqejrsxUJjUuVcSJ28gswBvTSq8GU/edit#gid=0).

## Writer Instructions

- Annotate ~15 minutes of class.
- Choose a title for your $\bluetext{subsection}$.
- Mark down start / end minute on class video recording (from NYU
    Classes / Panopto). There should not be temporal gaps between consecutive
    $\bluetext{subsections}$.
- Write ~300 words, formulas included (see style guide).
- Read one $\bluetext{subsection}$ before and after yours (this will span across
    weeks if your $\bluetext{subsection}$ is the first / last), work together the two
    corresponding editors to make the three $\bluetext{subsections}$ legible and uniform.

## Editor Instructions

- Review the assigned $\purpletext{section}$ (3 $\bluetext{subsections}$) for readability, typos,
    formatting (see style guide), start / end time stamps.
- Come up with a title for the $\purpletext{section}$ you’re reviewing.
- Write a ~50 word summary of the $\purpletext{section}$ and use it as text in your PR
    (pull request).
- Read one section before / after (this will span across weeks),
    add cross references, fix typos and inconsistencies, remove figure
    duplicates, etc…

Part 1 of lectures on Monday takes place from 4:55pm to 5:45pm. Part 2
of lectures on Monday takes place from 5:45pm to 6:35pm. The write-up
for a given class meeting is due a week after it takes place. Sunday
(Monday) evening is best so that students can read before class (lab)
on Monday (Tuesday).  Detailed instructions how to write/submit lecture
notes are [here](https://github.com/Atcold/SP19-DL-collaborative-notes/blob/master/instructions.tex).

## Logistics

### Grading, undergraduates and masters (default)
30% Homework.
<br/>30% Mid-term knowledge test on a $\purpletext{date to be determined}$.
<br/>30% 2 or 3 people group project, 3 minute video presentation (up to 6 slides), plus short ICLR like article.
<br/>±10% lecture write-up (so do your work).

### HPC
Everyone in the class will receive access to the NYU
HPC cluster.  Instructions on how to use it can be found
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gh5HmFa4D8Etor2zMnMwBdppgA9nOqfs).

### Overleaf
NYU has free access to Overleaf for all faculty and students at [https://www.overleaf.com/edu/nyu](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/nyu).
You may want to use it for organising (among yourselves) the individual contribution to the lecture notes.

## Office Hours
You find us on Piazza :p Your questions are likely to be others’
questions as well. So, it’s nice to have them all in one place. Also,
answering others’ questions will give you extra bonus points.

## Homework
There will be homework assignments due roughly every 2 weeks. More
details will be added here as we progress through the semester. No late
submissions will be accepted.  If you have any special circumstances,
please reach out to the TAs before the submission deadline.

Homework Assignment 1: TBA
<br/>Due ~ mid February

Homework Assignment 2: TBA
<br/>Due ~ beginning of March

Homework Assignment 3: TBA
<br/>Due ~ end of March
