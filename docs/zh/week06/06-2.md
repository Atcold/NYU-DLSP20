## 深度学习架构

在深度学习中，有不同的模块来实现不同的功能。深度学习的专业知识包括设计架构以完成特定任务。这是有点像过去使用算法编写的程序对计算机来发出指令，深度学习将复杂的功能简化为一些图形模块（也可以是动态的），这些功能的是由通过网络架构学习來建立的。

就像我们在卷积网络中看到的那样，网络模块架构是很重要。


## 循环神经网络(RNN)

在卷积神经网络中，模块之间的图形或他們的連接是沒有循环的。 卷积神经网络的模块中是有顺序,就好像有输出就有输入。

 - $x(t)$ : 随时间变化的输入函数
 - $\text{Enc}(x(t))$: 能生成代表输入数据的编码器
 - $h(t)$: 代表输入数据的数据
 - $w$: 可训练的参数
 - $z(t-1)$: 先前的隐藏状态，也是上一步时间的输出
 - $z(t)$: 当前的隐藏状态
 - $g$: 可以是复杂神经网络的函数； 其中一个输入是 $z(t-1)$ ，它是上一步时间的输出
 - $\text{Dec}(z(t))$: 生成输出的解码器


## 循环网络：摊开循环的网络的循环

摊开循环网络，他的输入是一个序列 $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_T$.

<center>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/week06/06-2/RNN_unrolled.png" /><br>
图2.摊开网络的循环网络
</center>

在图2中,输入是 $x_1, x_2, x_3$.

在时间点为零时(t=0), 输入  $x(0)$ 是被输入到编码器, $h(x(0)) = \text{Enc}(x(0))$ 。之后,将其输入到G以生成隐藏状态z。 $z(0) = G(h_0, z', w)$. 在时间点为零时(t=0)， $t = 0$, 用来输入给 $G$ 的 $z'$ 可以被初始化为$0$ 或随机初始化。 $z(0)$ i是会被输入到解码器来生成输出和成為下一步时间其中一個输入。

这个网络没有循环,我们可以实施反向传播。

图2显示了一个的常规网络具有的特定特征：每个分段块共享相同的权重。三个编码器，三个解码器和G函数在不同的时间点上的权重是一样的。

随时间反向传播（BPTT）：随时间反向传播。很可惜，随时间反向传播（BPTT）在循环神经网络的原本形式效果不佳。

循环网络的问题：

1. 循环网络
   - 在很长的序列中，渐变在每一个时间点中乘“权重矩阵（转置）”。权重矩阵中有很小值的值，渐变范数就越来越小，而且是指数地变小。

2. 梯度爆炸
   - 如果有权重矩阵是很大和非线性层是没有饱和，梯度就会爆炸。每次更新权重就变成一次又一次的划分。然后我们或许只能用学习率极低的学习率来解决问题。

使用循环神经网络的一个原因是因為它可以记住过去的信息。但是一个太过简单的循环神经网络可能因为记住很久的信息而失败。

一个消失梯度问题的例子:

输入是字符,是来自一个C程式。系统会说这个程式是否语法正确。语法正确的程式是会正确数量的有效数量的括号和括号。因此，网络应记住要检查的括号和花括号有多少个，以及是否括号包含另一些括号。网络必须如计数器一样在隐藏状态中存储此类信息。但是，由于梯度消失，它将无法在输出很较长的程式中保留此类信息。


##  循环神经网络的技巧

- 裁剪梯度:  (避免梯度爆炸)
    当梯度太大时，将其缩小。
- 初始化技巧 (在开始时就要避免梯度爆炸或梯度消失)
   初始化权重矩阵以在一定程度上保留一些标准来对应问题。 例如，正交初始化将权重矩阵初始化为随机正交矩阵。


## Multiplicative Modules

In multiplicative modules rather than only computing a weighted sum of inputs, we compute products of inputs and then compute weighted sum of that.

Suppose $x \in {R}^{n\times1}$, $W \in {R}^{m \times n}$, $U \in {R}^{m \times n \times d}$ and $z \in {R}^{d\times1}$. Here U is a tensor.

$$
w_{ij} = u_{ij}^\top z =
\begin{pmatrix}
u_{ij1} & u_{ij2} & \cdots &u_{ijd}\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
z_1\\
z_2\\
\vdots\\
z_d\\
\end{pmatrix} = \sum_ku_{ijk}z_k
$$

$$
s =
\begin{pmatrix}
s_1\\
s_2\\
\vdots\\
s_m\\
\end{pmatrix} = Wx =  \begin{pmatrix}
w_{11} & w_{12} & \cdots &w_{1n}\\
w_{21} & w_{22} & \cdots &w_{2n}\\
\vdots\\
w_{m1} & w_{m2} & \cdots &w_{mn}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1\\
x_2\\
\vdots\\
x_n\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $s_i = w_{i}^\top x = \sum_j w_{ij}x_j$.

The output of the system is a classic weighted sum of inputs and weights. Weights themselves are also weighted sums of weights and inputs.

Hypernetwork architecture: weights are computed by another network.


## Attention

$x_1$ and $x_2$ are vectors, $w_1$ and $w_2$ are scalars after softmax where $w_1 + w_2 = 1$, and  $w_1$ and $w_2$ are between 0 and 1.

$w_1x_1 + w_2x_2$ is a weighted sum of $x_1$ and $x_2$ weighted by coefficients $w_1$ and $w_2$.

By changing the relative size of $w_1$ and $w_2$, we can switch the output of $w_1x_1 + w_2x_2$ to $x_1$ or $x_2$ or some linear combinations of $x_1$ and $x_2$.

The inputs can have multiple $x$ vectors (more than $x_1$ and $x_2$). The system will choose an appropriate combination, the choice of which is determined by another variable z. An attention mechanism allows the neural network to focus its attention on particular input(s) and ignore the others.

Attention is increasingly important in NLP systems that use transformer architectures or other types of attention.

The weights are data independent because z is data independent.


## Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)

As mentioned above, RNN suffers from vanishing/exploding gradients and can’t remember states for very long. GRU, [Cho, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078), is an application of multiplicative modules that attempts to solve these problems. It's an example of recurrent net with memory (another is LSTM). The structure of A GRU unit is shown below:

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/week06/06-2/GRU.png" height="300px" style="background-color:#226;"/><br>
Figure 3. Gated Recurrent Unit
</center>

$$
\begin{array}{l}
z_t = \sigma_g(W_zx_t + U_zh_{t-1} + b_z)\\
r_t = \sigma_g(W_rx_t + U_rh_{t-1} + b_r)\\
h_t = z_t\odot h_{t-1} + (1- z_t)\odot\phi_h(W_hx_t + U_h(r_t\odot h_{t-1}) + b_h)
\end{array}
$$

where $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication(Hadamard product), $x_t$ is the input vector, $h_t$ is the output vector, $z_t$ is the update gate vector, $r_t$ is the reset gate vector, $\phi_h$ is a hyperbolic tanh, and $W$,$U$,$b$ are learnable parameters.

To be specific, $z_t$ is a gating vector that determines how much of the past information should be passed along to the future. It applies a sigmoid function to the sum of two linear layers and a bias over the input $x_t$ and the previous state $h_{t-1}$.  $z_t$ contains coefficients between 0 and 1 as a result of applying sigmoid. The final output state $h_t$ is a convex combination of $h_{t-1}$ and $\phi_h(W_hx_t + U_h(r_t\odot h_{t-1}) + b_h)$ via $z_t$. If the coefficient is 1, the current unit output is just a copy of the previous state and ignores the input (which is the default behaviour). If it is less than one, then it takes into account some new information from the input.

The reset gate $r_t$ is used to decide how much of the past information to forget. In the new memory content $\phi_h(W_hx_t + U_h(r_t\odot h_{t-1}) + b_h)$, if the coefficient in $r_t$ is 0, then it stores none of the information from the past. If at the same time $z_t$ is 0, then the system is completely reset since $h_t$ would only look at the input.


## LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

GRU is actually a simplified version of LSTM which came out much earlier, [Hochreiter, Schmidhuber, 1997](https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf). By building up memory cells to preserve past information, LSTMs also aim to solve long term memory loss issues in RNNs. The structure of LSTMs is shown below:

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/week06/06-2/LSTM.png" height="300px"/><br>
Figure 4. LSTM
</center>

$$
\begin{array}{l}
f_t = \sigma_g(W_fx_t + U_fh_{t-1} + b_f)\\
i_t = \sigma_g(W_ix_t + U_ih_{t-1} + b_i)\\
o_t = \sigma_o(W_ox_t + U_oh_{t-1} + b_o)\\
c_t = f_t\odot c_{t-1} + i_t\odot \tanh(W_cx_t + U_ch_{t-1} + b_c)\\
h_t = o_t \odot\tanh(c_t)
\end{array}
$$

where $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, $x_t\in\mathbb{R}^a$ is an input vector to the LSTM unit, $f_t\in\mathbb{R}^h$ is the forget gate's activation vector, $i_t\in\mathbb{R}^h$ is the input/update gate's activation vector, $o_t\in\mathbb{R}^h$ is the output gate's activation vector, $h_t\in\mathbb{R}^h$ is the hidden state vector (also known as output), $c_t\in\mathbb{R}^h$ is the cell state vector.

An LSTM unit uses a cell state $c_t$ to convey the information through the unit. It regulates how information is preserved or removed from the cell state through structures called gates. The forget gate $f_t$ decides how much information we want to keep from the previous cell state $c_{t-1}$ by looking at the current input and previous hidden state, and produces a number between 0 and 1 as the coefficient of $c_{t-1}$.  $\tanh(W_cx_t + U_ch_{t-1} + b_c)$ computes a new candidate to update the cell state, and like the forget gate, the input gate $i_t$ decides how much of the update to be applied. Finally, the output $h_t$ will be based on the cell state $c_t$, but will be put through a $\tanh$ then filtered by the output gate $o_t$.

Though LSTMs are widely used in NLP, their popularity is decreasing. For example, speech recognition is moving towards using temporal CNN, and NLP is moving towards using transformers.


## Sequence to Sequence Model

The approach proposed by [Sutskever NIPS 2014](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf) is the first neural machine translation system to have comparable performance to classic approaches. It uses an encoder-decoder architecture where both the encoder and decoder are multi-layered LSTMs.

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/week06/06-2/Seq2Seq.png" height="300px" /><br>
Figure 5. Seq2Seq
</center>

Each cell in the figure is an LSTM. For the encoder (the part on the left), the number of time steps equals the length of the sentence to be translated. At each step, there is a stack of LSTMs (four layers in the paper) where the hidden state of the previous LSTM is fed into the next one. The last layer of the last time step outputs a vector that represents the meaning of the entire sentence, which is then fed into another multi-layer LSTM (the decoder), that produces words in the target language. In the decoder, the text is generated in a sequential fashion. Each step produces one word, which is fed as an input to the next time step.

This architecture is not satisfying in two ways: First, the entire meaning of the sentence has to be squeezed into the hidden state between the encoder and decoder. Second, LSTMs actually do not preserve information for more than about 20 words. The fix for these issues is called a Bi-LSTM, which runs two LSTMs in opposite directions.  In a Bi-LSTM the meaning is encoded in two vectors, one generated by running LSTM from left to right, and another from right to left.  This allows doubling the length of the sentence without losing too much information.


## Seq2seq with Attention

The success of the approach above was short-lived. Another paper by [Bahdanau, Cho, Bengio](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473)  suggested that instead of having a gigantic network that squeezes the meaning of the entire sentence into one vector, it would make more sense if at every time step we only focus the attention on the relevant locations in the original language with equivalent meaning, i.e. the attention mechanism.

<center>

Figure 6. Seq2Seq with Attention
</center>

In attention, to produce the current word at each time step, we first need to decide which hidden representations of words in the input sentence to focus on. Essentially, a network will learn to score how well each encoded input matches the current output of the decoder. These scores are normalized by a softmax, then the coefficients are used to compute a weighted sum of the hidden states in the encoder at different time steps. By adjusting the weights, the system can adjust the area of inputs to focus on. The magic of this mechanism is that the network used to compute the coefficients can be trained through backpropagation. There is no need to build them by hand!

Attention mechanisms completely transformed neural machine translation. Later, Google published a paper [*Attention Is All You Need*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), and they put forward transformer, where each layer and group of neurons is implementing attention.


## Memory network

Memory networks stem from work at Facebook that was started by [Antoine Bordes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916) in 2014 and [Sainbayar Sukhbaatar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08895) in 2015.

The idea of a memory network is that there are two important parts in your brain: one is the **cortex**, which is where you have long term memory. There is a separate chunk of neurons called the **hippocampus** which sends wires to nearly everywhere in the cortex. The hippocampus is thought to be used for short term memory, remembering things for a relatively short period of time. The prevalent theory is that when you sleep, there is a lot of information transferred from the hippocampus to the cortex to be solidified in long term memory since the hippocampus has limited capacity.

For a memory network, there is an input to the network, $x$ (think of it as an address of the memory), and compare this $x$ with vectors $k_1, k_2, k_3, \cdots$ ("keys") through a dot product. Put them through a softmax, what you get are an array of numbers which sum to one. And there are a set of other vectors $v_1, v_2, v_3, \cdots$ ("values"). Multiply these vectors by the scalers from softmax and sum these vectors up (note the resemblance to the attention mechanism) gives you the result.

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/week06/06-2/MemoryNetwork1.png" height="300px"/><br>
Figure 7. Memory Network
</center>

If one of the keys (e.g. $k_i$) exactly matches $x$, then the coefficient associated with this key will be very close to one. So the output of the system will essentially be $v_i$.

This is **addressable associative memory**. Associative memory is that if your input matches a key, you get *that* value. And this is just a soft differentiable version of it, which allows you to backpropagate and change the vectors through gradient descent.

What the authors did was tell a story to a system by giving it a sequence of sentences. The sentences are encoded into vectors by running them through a neural net that has not been pretrained. The sentences are returned to the memory of this type. When you ask a question to the system, you encode the question and put it as the input of a neural net, the neural net produces an $x$ to the memory, and the memory returns a value.

This value, together with the previous state of the network, is used to re-access the memory. And you train this entire network to produce an answer to your question. After extensive training, this model actually learns to store stories and answer questions.

$$
\alpha_i = k_i^\top x \\
c = \text{softmax}(\alpha) \\
s = \sum_i c_i v_i
$$

In memory network, there is a neural net that takes an input and then produces an address for the memory, gets the value back to the network, keeps going, and eventually produces an output. This is very much like computer since there is a CPU and an external memory to read and write.

There are people who imagine that you can actually build **differentiable computers** out of this. One example is the [Neural Turing Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401) from DeepMind, which was made public three days after Facebook's paper was published on arXiv.

The idea is to compare inputs to keys, generate coefficients, and produce values - which is basically what a transformer is.  A transformer is basically a neural net in which every group of neurons is one of these networks.
