## Lecture part A


## Lecture part B

The second leg of the lecture further discusses the application of graphical model methods to energy-based models. After spending some time comparing different loss functions, we discuss the application of the vertirbi algorithm and forward algorithm to graphical transformer networks. We then transition to discussing the Lagrangian formulation of backpropagation and then variational inference for energy-based models.
