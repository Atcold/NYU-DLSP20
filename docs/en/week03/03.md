## Lecture part A

We first see a visualization of 6-layer neural network. Next we begin to the topic of Convolution and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). We review several types of parameter transformation in CNN and introduce the idea of a kernel, used to learn features in a hierarchical manner, and to classify our input data is the basic idea of a CNN.


## Lecture part B

We give an introduction on CNN evolutions. We discuss in detail on architectures of CNN with modern implementation of LeNet5, exemplified by the task of digit recognition on MNIST. Based on its design principles, we expand on the advantages of CNN which fully explores compositionality, stationarity, and locality features of natural images.


## Practicum

We give a brief introduction to supervised learning using artificial neural networks. We expound on the problem formulation and conventions of data used to train these networks. We also discuss how to train a neural network for multi class classification, and how to perform inference once the network is trained.
