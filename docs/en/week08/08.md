## Practicum

In this section, we discussed a specific type of generative model called Variational Autoencoders and compared their functionalities and advantages over Classic Autoencoders. We explored the objective function of VAE in detail, understanding how it enforced some structure in the latent space. Finally, we implemented and trained a VAE on the MNIST dataset and used it to generate new samples.
