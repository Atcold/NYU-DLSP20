## Lecture part A

In this section, we discuss the architecture and convolution of traditional convolutional neural networks. Then we extend to the graph domain. We understand the characteristics of graph and also define the graph convolution. Finally, we introduce spectral graph convolutional neural networks and discuss how to perform spectral convolution.
