GANs are a type of neural network used for unsupervised machine learning. They are comprised of two adversarial modules: _generator_ and _cost_ networks. These modules compete with each other such that the _cost_ network tries to filter fake examples while the _generator_ tries to trick this filter by creating realistic examples $\vect{\hat{x}}$. Through this competition, the model learns a generator that creates realistic data. They can be used in tasks such as future predictions or for generating images after being trained on a particular dataset.

GANs are examples of energy based models (EBMs). As such, th cost network is trained to produce low costs for inputs closer to the true data distribution denoted by the pink $\vect{x}$ in Fig. 2. Data from other distributions, like the blue $\vect{\hat{x}}$ in Fig. 2, should have high cost. A mean squared error (MSE) loss is typically used to calculate the cost network's performance. It is worth noting that the cost function outputs a positive scalar value within a specified range (i.e. $\text{cost} : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+ \cup {0}$). This is unlike a classic discriminator which uses discrete classfication for its outputs.

Meanwhile, the generator network ($\text{generator} : \mathcal{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$) is trained to improve its mapping of random variable $\vect{z}$ to realistic generated data $\vect{\hat{x}}$ to trick the cost network. The generator is trained with respect to the cost network's output, trying to minimize the energy of $\vect{\hat{x}}$. We denote this energy as $D(G(\vect{z}))$, where $D(\cdot)$ is the cost network and $G(\cdot)$ is the generator network.

The training of the cost network is based on minimizing the MSE loss, while the training of the generator network is through minimizing the cost network, using gradients of $D(\vect{\hat{x}})$ with respect to $\vect{\hat{x}}$.

## Difference Between Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

Compared to Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) from week 8, GANs create generators slightly differently. Recall, VAEs map inputs $\vect{x}$ to a latent space $\mathcal{Z}$ with an _encoder_ and then maps from $\mathcal{Z}$ back to the data space with a _decoder_ to get $\vect{\hat{x}}$. It then uses the reconstruction loss to push $\vect{x}$ and $\vect{\hat{x}}$ to be similar. GANs, on the other hand, train through an adversarial setting with the generator and cost networks competing as described above. These networks are successively trained through backpropagation through gradient based methods. Comparison of this architectual difference can be seen in Fig. 3.

GANs also differ from VAEs through how they produce and use $\vect{z}$. GANs start by sampling $\vect{z}$, similar to the latent space in a VAE. They then use a generative network to map $\vect{z}$ to $\vect{\hat{x}}$. This $\vect{\hat{x}}$ is then sent through a discriminator/cost network to evaluate how "real" it is. One of the main differences from VAE and GAN is that **we do not need to measure a direct relationship (i.e, reconstruction loss) between the output of the generative network $\vect{\hat{x}}$ and real data $\vect{x}$.** Instead, we force $\vect{\hat{x}}$ to be similar to $\vect{x}$ by training the generator to produce $\vect{\hat{x}}$ such that the discriminator/cost network produces scores that are similar to those of real data $\vect{x}$, or more "real".



## Major Pitfalls in GANs

While GANs can be powerful for building generators, they have some major pitfalls.

### 1. Unstable Convergence

As the generator improves with training, the discriminator performance gets worse because the discriminator can no longer easily tell the difference between real and fake data. If the generator is perfect, then the manifold of the real and fake data will lie on top of each other and the discriminator will create many misclassifications.

This poses a problem for convergence of the GAN: the discriminator feedback gets less meaningful over time. If the GAN continues training past the point when the discriminator is giving completely random feedback, then the generator starts to train on junk feedback and its quality may collapse. [Refer to [training convergence in GANs](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/training)]

As a result of this adversarial nature between the generator and discriminator there is an unstable equilibrium point rather than an equilibrium.

###  2. Vanishing Gradient

Let's consider using the binary cross entropy loss for a GAN:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_\boldsymbol{x}[\log(D(\boldsymbol{x}))] + \mathbb{E}_\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}[\log(1-D(\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}))] \text{.}
$$


As the descriminator becomes more confident, $D(\vect{x})$ gets closer to $1$ and $D(\vect{\hat{x}})$ gets closer to $0$. This confidence moves the outputs of the cost network into flatter regions where the gradients become more saturated. These flatter regions provide small, vanishing gradients that hinder the generator network's training. Thus, when training a GAN, you want to make sure that the cost gradually increases as you become more confident.

### 3. Mode Collapse

 If a generator maps all $\vect{z}$'s from the sampler to a **single** $\vect{\hat{x}}$ that can fool the discriminator, then the generator will produce **only** that $\vect{\hat{x}}$. Eventually, the discriminator will learn to detect *specifically* this fake input. As a result, the generator simply finds the next most plausible $\vect{\hat{x}}$ and the cycle continues. As a result, the discriminator gets trapped in local minima while cycling through fake $\vect{\hat{x}}$'s. A possible solution to this issue is to enfore some penalty to the generator for always giving the same output given different inputs.

## Source Code from PyTorch Examples: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

The source code of the example can be found at <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/dcgan/main.py>

#### Generator

1. The generator upsamples the input using several `nn.ConvTranspose2d` modules seperated with `nn.BatchNorm2d` and `nn.ReLU`.
2. At the end of the sequential, the network uses `nn.Tanh()` to squash outputs to $(-1,1)$.
3. The input random vector has size $nz$. The output has size $nc \times 64 \times 64$, where $nc$ is the number of channels.  

```python
class Generator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.main = nn.Sequential(
            # input is Z, going into a convolution
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(     nz, ngf * 8, 4, 1, 0, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 8),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            # state size. (ngf*8) x 4 x 4
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 8, ngf * 4, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 4),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            # state size. (ngf*4) x 8 x 8
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 4, ngf * 2, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 2),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            # state size. (ngf*2) x 16 x 16
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 2,     ngf, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            # state size. (ngf) x 32 x 32
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(    ngf,      nc, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.Tanh()
            # state size. (nc) x 64 x 64
        )

    def forward(self, input):
        output = self.main(input)
        return output
```

#### Discriminator

1. It is important to use `nn.LeakyReLU` as the activation function to avoid killing the gradients in negative regions. Without these gradients, the generator will not receive updates.
2. At the end of the sequential, the discriminator uses `nn.Sigmoid()` to classify the input.

```python
class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.main = nn.Sequential(
            # input is (nc) x 64 x 64
            nn.Conv2d(nc, ndf, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            # state size. (ndf) x 32 x 32
            nn.Conv2d(ndf, ndf * 2, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ndf * 2),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            # state size. (ndf*2) x 16 x 16
            nn.Conv2d(ndf * 2, ndf * 4, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ndf * 4),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            # state size. (ndf*4) x 8 x 8
            nn.Conv2d(ndf * 4, ndf * 8, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(ndf * 8),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            # state size. (ndf*8) x 4 x 4
            nn.Conv2d(ndf * 8, 1, 4, 1, 0, bias=False),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, input):
        output = self.main(input)
        return output.view(-1, 1).squeeze(1)
```

These two classes are initialized as `netG` and `netD`.

#### Loss function for GAN

We use Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) between target and output. 

```python
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
```

#### Setup

We set up `fixed_noise` of size `opt.batchSize` and length of random vector `nz`. We also create labels for real data and generated (fake) data called `real_label` and `fake_label`, respectively.

```python
fixed_noise = torch.randn(opt.batchSize, nz, 1, 1, device=device)
real_label = 1
fake_label = 0
```

Then we set up optimizers for discriminator and generator networks.

```python
optimizerD = optim.Adam(netD.parameters(), lr=opt.lr, betas=(opt.beta1, 0.999))
optimizerG = optim.Adam(netG.parameters(), lr=opt.lr, betas=(opt.beta1, 0.999))
```

#### Training

Each epoch of training is divided into two steps.

**Step 1** is to update the discriminator network. This is done in two parts. First, we feed the discriminator real data coming from dataloaders, compute the loss between the output and `real_label`, and then accumulate gradients with backpropagation. Second, we feed the discriminator data generated by the generator network using the `fixed_noise`, compute the loss between the output and `fake_label`, and then accumulate the gradient. Finally, we use the accumulated gradients to update the parameters for the discriminator network.

Note that we detach the fake data to stop gradients from propagating to the generator while we train the discriminator.

Also note that we only need to call `zero_grad()` once in the beginning to clear the gradients so the gradients from both the real and fake data can be used for the update. The two `.backward()` calls accumulate these gradients. We finally only need one call of `optimizerD.step()` to update the parameters.

```python
# train with real
netD.zero_grad()
real_cpu = data[0].to(device)
batch_size = real_cpu.size(0)
label = torch.full((batch_size,), real_label, device=device)

output = netD(real_cpu)
errD_real = criterion(output, label)
errD_real.backward()
D_x = output.mean().item()

# train with fake
noise = torch.randn(batch_size, nz, 1, 1, device=device)
fake = netG(noise)
label.fill_(fake_label)
output = netD(fake.detach())
errD_fake = criterion(output, label)
errD_fake.backward()
D_G_z1 = output.mean().item()
errD = errD_real + errD_fake
optimizerD.step()
```

**Step 2** is to update the Generator network. This time, we feed the discriminator the fake data, but compute the loss with the `real_label`! The purpose of doing this is to train the generator to make realistic $\vect{\hat{x}}$'s.

```python
netG.zero_grad()
label.fill_(real_label)  # fake labels are real for generator cost
output = netD(fake)
errG = criterion(output, label)
errG.backward()
D_G_z2 = output.mean().item()
optimizerG.step()
```
