## Practicum part A

When encountering the data with multiple outputs for a single input, feed-forward networks cannot capture such implicit dependencies. Instead, latent-variable energy-based models (EBMs) come to the rescue. We developed a toy ellipse example with a fixed input and the optimal model formulation. Then, we applied latent-variable EBMs to inference the best latent variables that can learn the implicit relationships.
