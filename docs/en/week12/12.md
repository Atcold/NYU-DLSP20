## Lecture part A

In this section we discuss the various architectures used in NLP applications, beginning with CNNs, RNNs, and
eventually covering the state of-the art architecture, transformers. We then discuss the various modules that
comprise transformers and how they make transformers advantageous for NLP tasks. Finally, we discuss tricks that
allow transformers to be trained effectively.
