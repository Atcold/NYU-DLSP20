## Lecture part A

In this section we discuss the various architectures used in NLP applications, beginning with CNNs, RNNs, and eventually covering the state of-the art architecture, transformers. We then discuss the various modules that comprise transformers and how they make transformers advantageous for NLP tasks. Finally, we discuss tricks that allow transformers to be trained effectively. 


## Lecture part B


## Practicum

We introduce attention, focusing on self-attention and its hidden layer representations of the inputs. Then, we introduce the key-value store paradigm and discuss how to represent queries, keys, and values as rotations of an input. Finally, we use attention to interpret the transformer architecture, taking a forward pass through a basic transformer, and comparing the encoder-decoder paradigm to sequential architectures.
