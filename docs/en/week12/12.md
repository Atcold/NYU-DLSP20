## Lecture part A


## Lecture part B


## Practicum

We introduce attention, focusing on self-attention and its hidden layer representations of the inputs. Then, we introduce the key-value store paradigm and discuss how to represent queries, keys, and values as rotations of an input. Finally, we use attention to interpret the transformer architecture, taking a forward pass through a basic transformer, and comparing the encoder-decoder paradigm to sequential architectures.
