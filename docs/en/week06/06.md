## Lecture part A

We discussed three applications of convolutional neural networks. We started with digit recognition and the application to a 5-digit zip code recognition. In object detection, we talk about how to use multi-scale architecture in a face detection setting. Lastly, we saw how ConvNets are used in semantic segmentation tasks with concrete examples in a robotic vision system and object segmentation in an urban environment.



## Lecture part B

We examine Recurrent Neural Networks, their problems, and common techniques for mitigating these issues.  We then review a variety of modules developed to resolve RNN model issues including Attention, GRUs (Gated Recurrent Unit), LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory), and Seq2Seq.



## Practicum
We discussed architecture of Vanilla RNN and LSTM models and compared the performance between the two. LSTM inherits advantages of RNN, while improving RNN's weaknesses by including a 'memory cell' to store information in memory for long periods of time. LSTM models significantly outperforms RNN models.
