## Lecture part A



## Lecture part B

We discussed self-supervised learning, introduced training an Energy-based models, Latent Variable EBM, specifically K-means example. We also introduced Contrastive Methods including DAE, details of BERT, Contrastive Divergence.

## Practicum
We discussed some applications of Autoencoders and talked about why we want to use them. Then we talked about different architectures of Autoencoders (under or over complete hidden layer), how to avoid overfitting issues and loss functions we should use. Finally we implemented a standard Autoencoder and a denoising Autoencoder.
