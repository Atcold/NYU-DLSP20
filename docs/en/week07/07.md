## Lecture part A



## Lecture part B



## Practicum
We discussed some applications of Autoencoders and talked about why we want to use them. Then we talked about different architectures of Autoencoders (under or over complete hidden layer), how to avoid overfitting issues and loss functions we should use. Finally we implemented a standard Autoencoder and a denoising Autoencoder.
