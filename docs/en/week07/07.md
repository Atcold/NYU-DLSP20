## Lecture part A



## Lecture part B

We discussed self-supervised learning, introduced how to train an Energy-based models, discussed Latent Variable EBM, specifically with explained K-means example. We also introduced Contrastive Methods, explained DAE with topographic map, the training process, and how it can be used, followed by introduction to BERT. Finally, we talked about Contrastive Divergence and explained with topographic map as well.

## Practicum
We discussed some applications of Autoencoders and talked about why we want to use them. Then we talked about different architectures of Autoencoders (under or over complete hidden layer), how to avoid overfitting issues and loss functions we should use. Finally we implemented a standard Autoencoder and a denoising Autoencoder.
