Guest Lecture by Ishan Misra, Research Scientist at FAIR.

## Lecture part A

In this section, we understand the motivation behind Self-Supervised Learning, define what it is and see some of its applications in NLP and Computer Vision. We understand how pretext tasks aid with SSL and see some example pretext tasks in images, videos and videos with sound. Finally, we try to get an intuition behind the representation learned by pretext tasks.
