Here's chapter 1

Here is some math: $$\mathcal{G} e^ix = \sin(x) + i \cos(x)$$

Euler's identity $$e^{i\pi}+1=0$$ is a beautiful formula in $$\mathbb{2}$$.

Here's a more complicated formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{n+1} &= \frac{x_{n+1} + nc_n}{n+1} \\
\iff a_{n+1} &= a_n + \frac{x_{n+1} - a_n}{n+1}
\end{aligned}
$$
