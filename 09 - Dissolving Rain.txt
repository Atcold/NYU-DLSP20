There you are!
I'm Mitsuboshi. I called earlier.
You're Asahi Koube, right?
Nice to meet you.
I told you over the phone. I found a clue related to your flyers
-while I was traveling. -Traveling?
It was at Yokoshina station.
It's far, but you can get there without changing trains.
It's not impossible.
What's your clue?
Hold on!
Shio... Shio...
Shio!
SHIO KOUBE
Someone had turned that in to the station.
I thought there might be
a connection with the girl in the flyer.
Am I right?
But she's been missing for three months now, right?
The most likely explanation
is that someone lured her and took her somewhere.
In that case, that person would try to run far away
instead of staying around here.
Your odds of finding her are better there than here.
He's right.
This is real. It's Mom's handwriting.
This is definitely Shio's.
This is my first clue!
This guy's story makes sense.
But there's still something holding me back.
Why? Why?
Think! Think! Think!
Hey. I can help you.
-So-- -Wait!
-Can I ask you something? -Okay.
How did you know I was the person you called just by looking at me?
What are you talking about?
We met each other before, right?
I saved you when those thugs were bothering you.
-No! -Huh?
Then why didn't you say that earlier?
You didn't say anything about that until now.
That's weird! Something's off!
You're hiding something.
You're trying to trick me.
This is just a game for you, right?
You smell like a dirty grown-up!
You smell like a dirty, lying, hopeless hypocrite of an adult!
I'm nothing like that woman!
I'm nothing like that woman...
Stop saying I'm like that dirty woman!
No! I'm not like her!
Wait!
Shio...
Shio... Shio...
Shio... Shio!
I'm an idiot.
That guy
is my real clue for finding Shio!
He's gone.
He's gone.
He's gone.
There are lots of threads.
I finally found a real one.
I should be happy.
But my heart feels like it's about to be crushed.
If I pull this thread, I might find the answer.
Shio might not be alive anymore...
It's like I'm walking towards the edge of a cliff.
The further I go, the more scared I get.
But even so, I can't let go of this thread.
No matter what the answer is...
I won't give up!
My biggest fear is not being able to find her.
So I'm going to find her! No matter what!
Shio...
How did it go?
I found a clue.
Who gave you the clue?
I don't know his name or his address.
All I know is that he was a young blond guy.
He looked like a hard-working guy.
Did he wear a hairpin?
Yeah.
Do you know him?
Sorry. I don't know.
But I don't think you should listen to him.
We're not even sure if that's true or not.
I'm going to go anyway.
Thanks for everything.
You're a good person.
I'm forever in your debt.
I think we'll never see each other again.
Take care.
Bye.
Why don't you just stop?
You look like you're in a lot of pain.
You should take care of yourself more!
You can't live on without feeling any happiness.
Can't you find happiness yourself first?
No.
This is the only kind of happiness I know.
They say there are many types of happiness.
But I can't understand. I can't imagine it.
Living together with my mom and Shio is my happiness.
Everything else is meaningless!
So I'm going to get Shio back for my happiness!
And I have to tell Shio not to turn out like me! That's why--
Sorry...
Sorry.
Sorry for saying something so mean.
I might be broken already.
That's not true!
You're amazing.
You really care about others.
You're shaking...
You're scared, but you're still moving forward.
You're amazing!
I hate it too.
I hate staying in the darkness and having regrets.
Yeah. I hate it.
Oh. Don't cry!
There, there.
Hey. You have a phone, right?
-Let's exchange numbers. -Huh?
Come on! I'll message you, okay?
I'm sure
there's light at the end of your journey.
So promise me
that you're going to smile at the end. Okay?
Oh, man.
I wonder why...
I'm jealous of her.
You're really weak and not very manly.
And you're not my type.
But I wish you were my prince.
Just kidding.
You look terrible.
9TH LIFE: DISSOLVING RAIN
I said everything I was supposed to.
I'm not sure whether he believed me, though.
I think he's suspicious.
Yeah. I got it.
I'll do what you tell me to, Matsuzaka.
So when are you going to let me see Shio-chan?
I see.
I'll do my best. Tell her I said hi.
I want Shio-chan to purify me soon!
Let's do this!
I knew it.
I knew he'd take the first train.
I'm glad I took action now.
The world outside is filled with impurities.
People I hate.
People in my way.
Liars.
Dirty people.
I need to eliminate all risks.
I was always alone.
Always numb.
Something was always missing.
I was always sad.
I thought I would end up dying alone.
But I was wrong.
Shio-chan found me and proved me wrong!
That's right!
The sky is sparkling.
Today's our anniversary!
An anniversary for celebrating the day I eliminated that thing!
Thank you!
I'm back!
Huh? Satou-chan, where did you go?
I smell something sweet!
Did you bring something?
Huh? I wonder what it is...
Hey! No keeping secrets!
You're a bad girl!
Wait! Shio-chan!
No... No, Shio-chan!
We're going to spend all day together today!
Really? Yay!
Mille-feuille, Charlotte,
black forest, Sachertorte and tiramisu.
Satou-chan, what's the occasion?
It's a tiny celebration.
This one's amazing! Black forest?
Sweet and soft! Black forest!
There are lots of different kinds of cake!
They're all sweet, but they're all a little different!
Satou-chan, cake is mysterious!
It's sweet, it's sweet...
Hey. Let's split them in half.
Are you sure?
I have to protect this life.
I want to eat them together!
This is where I belong.
Hey, Satou-chan.
Is it good?
Yup!
I'm going to protect her, no matter what!
It's really good!
In this sweet, gentle and pure castle.
-Hey, Satou-chan. -Hmm?
-Who made those cakes just now? -Huh?
Um...
Maybe it was someone at the bakery.
-Think I could bake them too? -Huh?
Satou-chan, you like cake, right?
But it won't happen anytime soon...
I've never cooked.
But I'll work hard!
I want to bake a cake for you someday
and make you smile!
-Someday? -Yeah! Someday.
From now... From here on...
Tomorrow... Next year... The future...
Huh?
What is this feeling?
Satou-chan?
I've never thought about the future until now.
It was sort of... You know...
My life didn't have any taste.
My days weren't even rusty.
They were meaningless.
But it's different now.
What should I do? I've never felt like this before!
It's fun to think about the future with you!
That's right!
I want to share every moment with you!
Forever and ever!
-Let's have a wedding! -Huh?
A wedding is a promise that you'll be together forever.
I heard about it.
So let's promise.
We'll be together forever! Okay?
I promise!
Let' have a wedding right now!
Let's get a veil and flowers!
Okay! Okay!
-I'll be right back, okay? -Okay!
Satou-chan, I love you!
I'm so happy right now!
Oh, Shio-chan.
Satou!
The little bird was abandoned by the girl,
and sunk to the ground
in loneliness.
However, as if by instinct,
she flew again.
The little bird tried to reach her heart.
The bird sang to her heart.
Her song
melted into the sound of the rain.
But she still sang.
She sang.
She sang.
She sang.
A gentle song.
The little bird won't give up anymore.
She's tired of giving up.
All that's left is to give it a try.
The cute little chick.
A cry-baby and a brave singing bird.
Face me! I'm sure we'll understand each other.
It's no use, Shoko-chan.
I don't feel anything for you at all.
You're no different from everyone else.
I don't care! Even if you're the devil,
I still love you!
I'll bring you back to the light!
Satou!
Hey.
Did you really think I'd buy your lie
that you're not telling the police?
You rejected me
that one time, remember?
How am I
supposed to believe a girl like that?
So...
Sorry.
Satou-chan?
The reason I can't hear the bird anymore
isn't because of the rain.
Satou-chan, did you really do it for me?
Are your eyes on me?
Or on yourself?
