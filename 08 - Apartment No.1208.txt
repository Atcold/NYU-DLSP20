Excuse me!
So, this is your room.
It's really clean.
Huh? Are you sure? If you say so.
Thanks. I feel refreshed now.
Your shirt is really big.
Do you live here alone?
That's nice.
Hey. I'll pay you back.
What do you want me to do?
A model for your art?
Here? Is it okay if I go in?
So, this is your atelier.
It's really organized.
Don't I have to take everything off?
Really?
This?
I don't know how to pose.
It's hard to just pose "like normal."
I'm just going to sit still.
Hey. Are you sure you don't want to have sex?
You really are weird.
Are you not interested in me?
Or are you not interested in girls?
I see.
But maybe that's normal.
I don't really know.
I think it's okay.
Everyone's different.
Sure. You can ask me anything.
My hobby? What's my hobby?
Movies and shopping.
I like having tea too. And chatting in cafÃ©s.
Guys always want to fool around.
So it's easier being with girls.
When we're eating dessert and talking,
time goes by so fast.
My dream?
My dream...
I sort of have one and I sort of don't.
A TV personality? I could never do that!
They're really amazing. They laugh and talk for other people.
Hey. Do you spend all day
drawing pictures every day?
Replicas?
You can make money with that?
That's amazing.
That's not true. Even if it's a counterfeit,
as long as the viewer thinks it's real,
that's amazing.
We're done for the day? Then I'm going home.
Are you mad?
Oh, really? Good.
I'll come again.
All I have to do is sit here,
but still, even that's pretty hard.
No. I'm fine.
Is this your first time? To draw someone?
Hey. Why did you want to draw me?
You don't know?
Well...
There's a lot of things I don't understand either.
I don't need that.
You let me into your room.
I'm paying you back by being your model.
If that's not how it is, I'm not coming here anymore.
Hey. Do you know what love is?
I see. So, you don't know.
Well, you are all alone.
Huh? I want to know.
I want to know what love is.
I don't understand.
Even when someone says they love me, or when we get intimate,
I don't feel anything.
Something's always missing. I'm never satisfied.
I'm incomplete. That's why I want to know.
I want to know love and feel satisfied.
You're cheering for me?
Thanks!
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE YOU COMPLETE
When are you going to finish your drawing?
Soon? Let me see.
Wow. That's amazing.
Though, I'm not that pretty.
So, this is what I look like to you.
Really?
It'll be finished soon.
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HER EXPRESSION MEANT
Sorry! I had nowhere else to go!
This girl?
This girl is my...
I'm not really sure.
But when I'm with her, I feel warm
and soft.
I wish I could hold her forever.
My face?
I don't know what you mean.
Hey. Can we come in?
Thanks.
Can I borrow a towel?
And I want to give her a bath.
Get out of the way!
WHAT'S UP WITH HER FACE?
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER
LOOK SO HAPPY
AND SATISFIED!
DISGUSTING! DISGUSTING! DISGUSTING! DISGUSTING! DISGUSTING!
THAT'S NOT WHO SHE IS!
WHAT IS THIS FEELING?
OH. I SEE.
I
LIKED HOW SHE WAS INCOMPLETE.
I LIKE HER WHEN SHE'S CRYING
THAT SHE'S NOT
SATISFIED.
THAT'S WHY
SHE'S IN THE WAY.
I TRULY REGRET IT.
I REGRET I COULDN'T SEE HER FACE IN THE END.
I think I understand now, thanks to you.
This is the first time I've ever
gone so far for someone.
I thought I'd never feel satisfied.
But I've finally found it.
I understand now.
I know what this feeling is called.
Thank you.
8TH LIFE: APARTMENT NO. 1208
No! It's dangerous, Hida! Don't go!
What if you fall in love with Shio-chan?
What am I doing?
I'm going home.
I ran out of my house when I saw
Matsuzaka's message.
What is she up to?
Did she really capture Shio-chan?
But why?
I don't understand. I don't understand,
but I bet the reason she keeps coming to my house
is because she heard about me from Shio-chan.
This feels dangerous.
MOM: TAIYO, ARE YOU OKAY? LET ME KNOW. I'M WORRIED.
What am I doing?
Sorry, Mom. Sorry.
I'm going to stop.
I'm going to become normal.
I'm going to face it!
I'm going to face the trauma!
Hey, you.
Oh, sorry to surprise you.
You were acting weird.
Are you okay?
Wait!
No! No! No! No! No!
Help me! Anyone!
MISSING PERSON SHIO KOUBE
I'm going to
stop getting involved.
As long as I have this, I can go on.
I'm going to go to school
with this in my pocket.
I have to get over my fear of girls. I'm going to start working.
With this in my pocket.
And I'm going to become normal,
graduate, and go to work.
I'm going to become a respectable adult.
With this in my pocket.
You want to see Shio-chan?
Matsuzaka.
Let's be friends
from work again tomorrow, like always.
What's wrong?
Sorry. I forgot to bring bread today. I'll go buy some.
No. Hold on.
You're crying. You don't have to go now.
How did you know? You didn't look at my face.
Mitsuboshi, it's been a while.
I was worried about you.
I wanted to see you.
Shio-chan is cute, right?
She really is like an angel.
Her soft hair like a cat.
Her soft cheeks.
Her soft, smooth skin.
It's really amazing.
She's so cute. I can't control myself.
Hey.
You're in love with Shio-chan, right?
Are you jealous?
What is this? What is this?
What is this?
Thanks for not telling the police.
You wanted to be able to see Shio-chan again.
I know you'd do anything for Shio-chan.
That's why I want to ask you.
Shio-chan is really happy right now.
But there's someone who's trying to destroy it. Mitsuboshi,
can you help me get rid of that person?
What?
If you do that, I'll let you see Shio-chan.
You want to see her, right?
You want to hear her say, "Good boy," right?
You're going to be Shio-chan's knight in shining armor.
I'd never do it! I've decided to become a decent person!
I don't care about Shio-chan anymore! That's right! I don't care anymore!
I don't want things to get any crazier!
Your problems are none of my business! It's none of my business!
So, just leave me alone--
A sock she just took off.
Do you know whose it is?
It smells like milk.
An angel!
I'm being purified!
She's divine!
Angel Shio Koube!
I'd do anything for you.
I'd do anything to be touched by you!
I'll do anything!
Thanks.
I hurt my friend.
She was really important to me.
I wanted to protect our bond.
But I rejected her when it really mattered.
I shouldn't have tried so hard.
I shouldn't have stopped halfway.
Then I could have still been having fun with her now.
I can't take it anymore.
I don't deserve to be alive.
I wish I just disappeared.
Stop!
Kind people always blame themselves.
That's why they shatter.
You tried hard. You were brave.
Don't try to erase yourself.
I think you're amazing. And I respect you.
So...
Good girl. There, there.
Sorry.
No! It's okay. It's just...
You're the one who's trying hard.
You're always posting flyers. You never give up.
That's all I have.
Hey! You should have more confidence in yourself!
You gave me courage.
Thanks.
I wish this world
was a place where
kind people were rewarded for their kindness.
DINER RAIN
In other words... Is this what you mean?
There's a guy searching for Shio-chan and trying to take her away.
And you want to do something about it. Right?
That's right.
I don't want to interact with him.
I said, "Get rid of him,"
but I don't want to do anything violent.
Yeah.
I want you to get him to go somewhere far away.
Somewhere far away from here. Where it's hard to look for her.
Like the next prefecture over. That's realistic.
I think Matsuzaka is superior to others.
She's smart and calm.
And very beautiful.
Why is someone like her...?
I don't understand.
You could choose to have a normal happy life.
Why are you so set on Shio-chan?
You can understand, right?
You understand that I don't know the reason.
The only thing I understand is the result, not the reason.
My heart reacted to Shio-chan.
I wanted to touch her. I wanted to hug her.
She made me happy.
She made me feel true happiness.
You must understand, right?
Right?
Shio-chan is an angel. That's not just a guess.
It's a given!
But angels are weak and frail.
That's why we have to protect them
from the dirty world.
What do I get if I help you?
I told you, right?
The knight will earn the right to see the angel.
But if you help out even more, I'm sure the angel
would be happy.
Taiyo!
Good boy! Good boy!
Okay.
Okay.
I'm counting on you, knight!
Shio.
Here.
I'm okay.
Yes? Hello?
Yes. About the flyers?
Yes.
I get a lot of prank calls.
I'm tired. Can you tell me about your information
before we meet?
A clue?
Shio-chan, thanks for being with me.
Our love will shine even brighter.
Forever. In this cage.
