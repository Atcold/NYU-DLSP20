# ðŸ¤– Introduction to AI, ML, and Deep Learning

Understanding the differences between **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)** is very important for anyone working in tech or data science.

---

## ðŸ§  What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

**Artificial Intelligence** is the science of making machines or software **act smart** â€” like humans.

It includes:
- Learning
- Reasoning
- Problem-solving
- Decision making

### Example:
- A chatbot that can answer your questions
- A self-driving car

---

## ðŸ¤– What is Machine Learning (ML)?

**Machine Learning** is a **subset of AI**.  
It means a machine can **learn from data** instead of being programmed with fixed rules.

> "The more data you give it, the better it performs."

### Example:
- Spam email detection
- Predicting delivery time based on location and weather
- Recommending products (Netflix, Amazon)

---

## ðŸ§¬ What is Deep Learning (DL)?

**Deep Learning** is a **subset of ML**.  
It uses a model called a **neural network**, inspired by the human brain.

> Deep Learning is good with complex tasks like images, audio, and natural language.

### Example:
- Face recognition
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Language translation
